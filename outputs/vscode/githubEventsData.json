Change two different locations in a file.\r\n1. Select the changed lines in one location (with the mouse) and choose **Git: Stage Selected Ranges** from the palette (I open it with Ctrl-Shift-P).\r\n2. Fill in a commit message and commit the change by pressing Ctrl-Enter.\r\n3. Click off the previous selection and select the other change.

Open a new untitled tab. \r\n2. Type something in it. \r\n3. Close it, and it will tell you there are still unsaved changes. Choose `Don't save`.\r\n4. Sometimes, the `1` badge will still appear on the `Explorer` icon, indicating that the unsaved document is still open in the background.\r\n\r\nThis occurs to me about once a day. I notice it when I close a workspace, and it notifies me that there are still unsaved changes, yet I can't see any, except for the badge. I frequently open new untitled tabs, type something in them, then close them, without saving. \r\n\r\nIt's very difficult to pinpoint the cause. It seems to matter at what point I close the tab. \r\n\r\nThe problem may *possibly* occur when I close the document and the `Git` icon is showing the `refresh` badge. Since the `refresh` badge appears for less than a second, and perhaps once every minute or so, it's hard to reproduce this event purposely, yet the event of closing an unsaved document and this badge appearing occurs pretty frequent on a daily basis, by accident.\r\n\r\nI've had this bug for months, perhaps about three months or more.\r\n\r\n<!-- Launch with `code --disable-extensions` to check. -->\r\nDoes this issue occur when all extensions are disabled?: Yes\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/comments/442985632","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/59680#issuecomment-442985632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/59680","id":442985632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0Mjk4NTYzMg==","user":{"login":"garyking","id":343940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Mzk0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/343940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyking","html_url":"https://github.com/garyking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garyking/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-29T20:41:50Z","updated_at":"2018-11-29T20:41:50Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"No, this bug is that occasionally, when I close an untitled file, the dirty counter does not go down.

Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nI have just downloaded the latest release and have been trying to use VSCode rather than the PowerShell ISE, but am running into issues already. Aside from the sidebar that I cannot seem to permanently hide (pops back up every time I run a script), I keep getting the error mentioned above. I am working on a pretty long GUI script for building servers in VMware, and from time to time when I run the script I get this error. I have tried the exact same script in ISE and it works just fine. Some times if I simply re-launch the error goes away. Other times I have to close VSCode and restart. Currently I am getting a 60 second delay before the error pops up, and even a restart has not resolved it. The only Problems noted in the bottom pane are warnings regarding my use of cls and foreach, suggesting I use the full syntax. No errors in Output or Debug Console, and nothing in Terminal.\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.29.1 (bc24f98b5f70467bc689abf41cc5550ca637088e, 2018-11-15T19:13:36.375Z)\r\nOS version: Windows_NT x64 10.0.16299\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>System Info</summary>\r\n\r\n|Item|Value|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|CPUs|Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz (4 x 2712)|\r\n|GPU Status|2d_canvas: enabled<br>checker_imaging: disabled_off<br>flash_3d: enabled<br>flash_stage3d: enabled<br>flash_stage3d_baseline: enabled<br>gpu_compositing: enabled<br>multiple_raster_threads: enabled_on<br>native_gpu_memory_buffers: disabled_software<br>rasterization: enabled<br>video_decode: enabled<br>video_encode: enabled<br>webgl: enabled<br>webgl2: enabled|\r\n|Memory (System)|7.87GB (1.34GB free)|\r\n|Process Argv||\r\n|Screen Reader|no|\r\n|VM|0%|\r\n\r\n</details><details><summary>Extensions (1)</summary>\r\n\r\nExtension|Author (truncated)|Version\r\n---|---|---\r\nPowerShell|ms-|1.9.0\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n<!-- generated by issue reporter -->"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/comments/442960175","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/64015#issuecomment-442960175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/64015","id":442960175,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0Mjk2MDE3NQ==","user":{"login":"JLogan3o13","id":14804589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODA0NTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14804589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLogan3o13","html_url":"https://github.com/JLogan3o13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLogan3o13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLogan3o13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLogan3o13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLogan3o13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLogan3o13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLogan3o13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLogan3o13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLogan3o13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLogan3o13/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-29T19:22:36Z","updated_at":"2018-11-29T19:22:36Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I found the issue for the particular script I am working on at the moment; it was a simple type in the code, I transposed letters in a variable.

Reproduce:\r\n\r\nThe return type for `showQuickPick` depends on the type of the first argument. For simplicity, in the code snippets below, I'm just using `vscode.QuickPickitem` as my type, but the behaviour is of course the same for any object implementing this interface.\r\n\r\nSince the user can select multiple items for this QP, I want to be able to capture those items in an array. So I would expect the following to work:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8888438/49244932-f98f2f80-f3de-11e8-88df-267511459932.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, the return type doesn't match this. The return type is always declared as 1 QuickPickItem (or undefined).\r\n\r\nI change my code so that it can compile (just changed the typing of `selection`)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8888438/49244734-81c10500-f3de-11e8-8029-eadd2c4084cd.png)\r\n\r\nAt runtime, however, an array is in fact returned (whether I select 1 or multiple items):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8888438/49244537-095a4400-f3de-11e8-96dd-eb11020baaea.png)\r\n\r\nSo if I want to call Array methods on `selection`, I have to mark it as \"any\" type and use `as` :(\r\n\r\nIn terms of potential solutions:\r\nI'm still pretty new to TypeScript, but I would be shocked to learn that it's possible to change the return type of this function depending on the `canPickMany` option :)\r\nMaybe the team already discussed adding a new function like `window.showMultiQuickPick` with the correct return type, but decided this solution was better for simplicity despite this shortcoming. I would be OK with that, but I wanted to bring attention to this in case you all weren't aware."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/comments/442958300","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/64014#issuecomment-442958300","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/64014","id":442958300,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0Mjk1ODMwMA==","user":{"login":"tetchel","id":8888438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODg0Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8888438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tetchel","html_url":"https://github.com/tetchel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tetchel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tetchel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tetchel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tetchel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tetchel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tetchel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tetchel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tetchel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tetchel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-29T19:16:42Z","updated_at":"2018-11-29T19:16:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry,

Aside from the sidebar that I cannot seem to permanently hide (pops back up every time I run a script), I keep getting the error mentioned above. I am working on a pretty long GUI script for building servers in VMware, and from time to time when I run the script I get this error. I have tried the exact same script in ISE and it works just fine. Some times if I simply re-launch the error goes away. Other times I have to close VSCode and restart. The only Problems noted in the bottom pane are warnings regarding my use of cls and foreach, suggesting I use the full syntax.

For simplicity, in the code snippets below, I'm just using `vscode.QuickPickitem` as my type, but the behaviour is of course the same for any object implementing this interface.\r\n\r\nSince the user can select multiple items for this QP, I want to be able to capture those items in an array. So I would expect the following to work:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8888438/49244747-8a194000-f3de-11e8-9ca7-e8ea4302dd8a.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, the return type doesn't match this. The return type is always declared as 1 QuickPickItem.\r\n\r\nI change my code so that it can compile:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8888438/49244734-81c10500-f3de-11e8-8029-eadd2c4084cd.png)\r\n\r\nAt runtime, however, an array is in fact returned (whether I select 1 or multiple items):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8888438/49244537-095a4400-f3de-11e8-96dd-eb11020baaea.png)\r\n\r\nIn terms of potential solutions:\r\nI'm still pretty new to TypeScript, but I would be shocked to learn that it's possible to change the return type of this function depending on the `canSelectMany` option :)\r\nMaybe the team already discussed adding a new function like `window.showMultiQuickPick` with the correct return type, but decided this solution was better for simplicity despite this shortcoming. I would be OK with that."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-11-29T18:58:25Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"Microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/Microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}},{"id":"8671360202","type":"IssuesEvent","actor":{"id":734910,"login":"nyalex","display_login":"nyalex","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyalex","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/734910?"},"repo":{"id":41881900,"name":"Microsoft/vscode","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode"},"payload":{"action":"opened","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/64013","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/64013/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/64013/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/64013/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/64013","id":385878565,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODU4Nzg1NjU=","number":64013,"title":"Comments look weird in diff via Github integration","user":{"login":"nyalex","id":734910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNDkxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/734910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyalex","html_url":"https://github.com/nyalex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyalex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyalex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyalex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyalex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyalex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyalex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyalex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyalex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nyalex/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-11-29T18:56:56Z","updated_at":"2018-11-29T18:56:56Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!-- Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates. -->\r\n<!-- Also please test using the latest insiders build to make sure your issue has not already been fixed: https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/ -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Use Help > Report Issue to prefill these. -->\r\n- VSCode Version: 1.29.1\r\n- OS Version: macOS Mojave 10.14\r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

I think that's overkill for this API. Let's keep this simpler option.

I also had to make a change to the workbench command handler to pass the argument, let me know if this looks reasonable.","created_at":"2018-11-28T22:56:50Z","updated_at":"2018-11-29T18:41:16Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8747bbf3e9e26c5bfc592ff65d9aa70c206118b8","assignee":{"login":"RMacfarlane","id":3672607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzI2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3672607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane","html_url":"https://github.com/RMacfarlane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"RMacfarlane","id":3672607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzI2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3672607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane","html_url":"https://github.com/RMacfarlane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RMacfarlane/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/81","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/81","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/milestones/81/labels","id":3739917,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzczOTkxNw==","number":81,"title":"November
