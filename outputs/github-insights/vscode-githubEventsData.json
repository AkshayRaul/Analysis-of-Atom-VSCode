But still when you want to pull form a remote repo and the delta is big, even though you see that there are unmerged files, there is not easy way to discover and merge the files. Most of the times you have to go to git support tab and from there try to commit the pulled changes and discover the merge requests. \r\n<!-- Describe the feature you'd like. -->\r\nThe interface should be enhanced, so that when there are conflicts to be merged , that is much more clear on the user interface. Also Instead of doing it in line on the editor it would be nicer to have split two column editor where in the middle you can merge and see the final outcome before saving and finalizing the merging. I know referring to features of another  IDE is not always the best, but I firmly believe the git support of IntelliJ and in general IDEA family IDE's is something extremely intuitive\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2018-11-25T17:36:33Z","org":{"id":6154722,"login":"Microsoft","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/Microsoft","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6154722?"}},{"id":"8643363373","type":"IssueCommentEvent","actor":{"id":28792856,"login":"vscodebot[bot]","display_login":"vscodebot","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vscodebot[bot]","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28792856?"},"repo":{"id":41881900,"name":"Microsoft/vscode","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode"},"payload":{"action":"created","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/62911","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/62911/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/62911/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/issues/62911/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/62911","id":379491406,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzk0OTE0MDY=","number":62911,"title":"VS Code in MAC OS Mojave in a VM in Parallel Desktop","user":{"login":"AngelValdes","id":6753973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTM5NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/6753973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelValdes","html_url":"https://github.com/AngelValdes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelValdes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelValdes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelValdes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelValdes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelValdes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelValdes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelValdes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelValdes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngelValdes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":272689423,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzI2ODk0MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Microsoft/vscode/labels/needs%20more%20info","name":"needs more info","color":"E2A1C2","default":false}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"bpasero","id":900690,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMDY5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/900690?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero","html_url":"https://github.com/bpasero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bpasero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-11-11T05:21:04Z","updated_at":"2018-11-25T17:13:27Z","closed_at":"2018-11-25T17:13:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Issue Type: <b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nUse Parallel Desktop 14 in Mojave to create a VM running Mac OS Mojave.

are quiet some extensions out there to handle setting synchronization between multiple computers. And in my opinion they are very important: Since vscode is very customizable with settings, keyboardshortcuts and extension it is very hard to synchronize those things between multiple workstations. And all those extensions are not really clean solutions, because vscode does nearly nothing to support them (for example the paths vscode uses are not exposed, see #2741).\n\nSo here some ideas to make synchronization clean and extensible:\n- add a contribution point for synchronization extensions\n  - Those extensions should not have to gather all the files that have to be synced. vscode should do this and then pass them to the extensions\n  - Such an extension's job is only to upload/download the files, passed to them (so we can have the `gist upload`/`svn upload`/`git repo upload`/`dropbox`/`filesystem`/`onedrive`/`ftp`/`other services`.\n  - Or maybe gather all settings into one big json object and pass that.\n  - Support versioning and non versioning extensions\n- add a remote_settings.json to build on top of the workspace-settings/user-settings stack.\n- allow automatic and user triggered synchronization\n\nOk... just some ideas :smile:
