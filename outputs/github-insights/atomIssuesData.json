Requirements for Adding, Changing, or Removing a Feature\r\n\r\n* Fill out the template below. Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* The pull request must contribute a change that has been endorsed by the maintainer team. See details in the template below.\r\n* The pull request must update the test suite to exercise the updated functionality. For guidance, please see https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/writing-specs/.\r\n* After you create the pull request, all status checks must be pass before a maintainer reviews your contribution. For more details, please see https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests.\r\n\r\n### Issue or RFC Endorsed by Atom's Maintainers\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nLink to the issue or RFC that your change relates to.

Treats it as an Oniguruma regex, so that the TextMate grammar is consistent with itself.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->\r\n\r\nCould make the `contentRegex` a regular JS regex, but then it would be the only regex like that for a TextMate grammar.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->\r\n\r\nCurrently it looks at the whole file, which is potentially dangerous for performace. The use case in the linked issue would be fine with 20 lines or less.

Selecting the current language/grammar again re-parses the file using Tree-Sitter.\r\n\r\nI have tested this on the following file extensions/grammars:\r\n\r\n- `.mjs`, `.es` - JavaScript\r\n- `.erb`, `.ruby` - Ruby\r\n\r\nThis problem **does not** occur when opening a file with the following (\"default\") extensions, meaning that Tree-Sitter is used immediately after opening the file (expected behaviour):\r\n\r\n- `.js` - JavaScript\r\n- `.rb` - Ruby\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Enable Tree-Sitter parsers\r\n2.

issue is a continuation of #18452 and https://github.com/desktop/dugite-native/issues/138.*\r\n\r\n*Edit by @rsese - see @shiftkey's comment at https://github.com/desktop/dugite-native/issues/138#issuecomment-438070892* - an excerpt:\r\n\r\n> We tried ASAR ages ago and ended up just avoiding it (see https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/476 and the linked PR for more info), and I see someone added support for being able to control the symlink behaviour (to opt-out of the default behaviour) in https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/pull/410.\r\n\r\n> Ultimately, this is up to the packaging apps rather than something I have control over. I don't see a `derefSymlinks` flag being set in the [Atom packager config](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/script/lib/package-application.js#L17-L38) so maybe it's worth asking over in [`atom/atom`](https://github.com/atom/atom) if they've tried `derefSymlinks` when packaging.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nDoesn't apply. This is not a runtime issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe Git distribution bundled with dugite-native contains hundreds of symlinks used to create aliases such as `git-imap-send`. The way Atom is currently packaged emulates those symlinks by creating a full copy of the link target for each of them. This wastes 270 MB of disk space.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install Atom\r\n2. Look inside `/node_modules/dugite/git/libexec/git-core` in the installation folder\r\n3. Notice there are 136 executables totaling 300 MB, 121 of which are identical (with different names)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The Atom installer/installation doesn't waste disk space and bandwidth like that.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Disk space and download bandwidth is wasted.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Always.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n*Edit by @rsese to note specific releases where there was a large increase in the size of the .rpm size and `atom-mac.zip`*\r\n\r\nFor the .rpm, saw the 2x size increase from 1.30 where the .rpm was 134 MB and atom-mac.zip was 139 MB:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.30.0\r\n\r\nAnd 1.31.0 where the .rpm size was 270 MB and atom-mac.zip was 272 MB:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.31.0\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n1.32.2, at least macOS and Linux are affected, but likely all platforms.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18488","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18488/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18488/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18488/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18488","id":383967767,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODM5Njc3Njc=","number":18488,"title":"Error when running `atom -version` instead of `atom --version`","user":{"login":"kane-sei","id":45293757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MjkzNzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/45293757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kane-sei","html_url":"https://github.com/kane-sei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kane-sei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kane-sei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kane-sei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kane-sei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kane-sei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kane-sei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kane-sei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kane-sei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kane-sei/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-11-24T07:40:04Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T04:23:27Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

The Atom message board is the best place for getting support: https://discuss.atom.io\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that Atom is highly customizable in a number of ways and we strongly prefer that you consider these options before filing this issue:\r\n\r\n* https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/: tweak Atom's configuration, styles, and keybindings.\r\n* https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/: install a community package.\r\n* https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/: use the Atom API in your init script, to create a package, or to enhance an existing package.\r\n\r\nIf you're convinced that none of these options are appropriate for the feature you want, please explain why that's the case by completely filling out the issue template below.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the Atom team has finite resources so it's unlikely that we'll work on feature requests. If we're interested in a particular feature however, we'll follow up and ask you to submit an RFC to talk about it in more detail.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nAdd a grammar API call to get an array of ranges of all scopes that match the given scope in the given selection.\r\n\r\nThe scope is not a selector; instead, it supports selector like syntax for a single scope. So `a.*.c` works like normal, but not things like negation (basically whatever relies on knowing more than the scope for a given tag).\r\n\r\nE.g., where `|` is the selection end, and we look for `string` in\r\n```js\r\nlet foo = |\"bar\"\r\nlet baz = [\"quux\", \"wib|ble\"]\r\n```\r\nit would return an array of the ranges of all three strings.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n~~Overengineering~~ a TextMate solution to https://github.com/atom/toggle-quotes/issues/36. To toggle quotes for all strings in the selection, it wants to get the ranges of all strings in that selection. This feature request is an attempt to provide the functionality, as well as possibly being generally useful.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nSupporting true scope selectors is technically possible, but probably slows it down a lot. My current implementation balances scope tags, and only inspects tags one at a time and caches the result.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, that issue could be resolved by doing a similar thing to this request in the `toggle-quotes` package itself, but not have it as part of any API.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nI've got a probably working version ready for TextMate, so this issue is more to see if it's good to add as part of the API.\r\n\r\nA similar feature would probably be good for Tree-sitter too, but I haven't got that yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe method could also be extended to take multiple selections (e.g., all selections in the TextEditor) and take multiple scopes, even blacklisted and whitelisted scopes (so it's more like a selector)."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18482","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18482/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18482/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18482/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18482","id":383679014,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODM2NzkwMTQ=","number":18482,"title":"Add

They should be allowed to use a regex like syntax (possibly even a ScopeSelector) to target multiple file root scopes.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWriting a `tree-sitter-todo` package, but can't apply it to all grammars cleanly. Ideally, it would use `*` to target all grammars, though a blacklist / whitelist of targets is even better.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI can iterate through all loaded grammars and add it like that, but I don't think this is particularly reliable or robust.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nI've got the [`language-todo`](https://github.com/Aerijo/language-todo) and [`tree-sitter-todo`](https://github.com/Aerijo/tree-sitter-todo) stuff mostly worked out, but this prevent it from being applied to all files like the TextMate version is.\r\n\r\nAlso, apologies for the excessive use of the external scanner.

Are you looking for support? The Atom message board is the best place for getting support: https://discuss.atom.io\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. With focus in Atom, bring up the windows software keyboard.\r\n\ta. If not on a touch device, right click the windows taskbar and turn on 'Show touch keyboard button'\r\n\tb. Click the newly added button to bring up the software keyboard.\r\n2. Switch the input language to Microsoft Pinyin (Chinese, Simplified)\r\n3. Hit Enter on the software keyboard to create a new line.\r\n4. Start typing normally to begin a composition.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Composition starts and I can type in Chinese.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Nothing is inserted into the editor.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.32.2\r\nElectron: 2.0.9\r\nChrome  : 61.0.3163.100\r\nNode    : 8.9.3\r\nWindows : 1809 (October update)\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis is due to the following `if` block:\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/blob/d2c38ac36a46c067b7f1fe1edc41bcf7b4b13e73/src/text-editor-component.js#L1716-L1728\r\n\r\nThe code block is gated on `lasKeydown` whose logic is maintained in the following:\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/blob/d2c38ac36a46c067b7f1fe1edc41bcf7b4b13e73/src/text-editor-component.js#L1672-L1690\r\n\r\nIn this scenario Chromium/Atom does not receive a `keydown` before the composition starts.\r\nThe first code block then incorrectly associates the composition event with the previous keydown (Enter Key) and then cancels the user action as that key was previously `defaultPrevented`.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is that there isn't a guarantee for there to be a key event before the compositionstart event (See W3C for [compositionstart](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#event-type-compositionstart)).\r\n> When a keyboard is used to feed an input method editor, this event type is generated after a keydown event, but speech or handwriting recognition systems MAY send this event type without keyboard events.\r\n\r\nI believe resetting `lastKeydown` on keyUp would prevent the composition event form being associated to the incorrect key event.\r\n\r\n*Edit by @rsese: Based on the pointer above, I see that code was added in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15266 and it looks like it landed in 1.20 where I could still reproduce.  But then going back to 1.19.0, the touch keyboard using Microsoft Pinyin worked ok.)*"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18417","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18417/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18417/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18417/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18417","id":379344357,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzkzNDQzNTc=","number":18417,"title":"Atom stuck on 1.34.0-nightly9","user":{"login":"wolfy1339","id":4595477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTU0Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4595477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfy1339","html_url":"https://github.com/wolfy1339","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfy1339/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfy1339/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfy1339/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfy1339/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfy1339/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfy1339/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfy1339/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfy1339/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfy1339/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":990818455,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTA4MTg0NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/:night_with_stars:%20nightly-releases","name":":night_with_stars: nightly-releases","color":"bfb6ef","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false},{"id":62363277,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjM2MzI3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-11-09T22:29:45Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T06:54:48Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Open some file with code, the files that cause this for me are .js\r\n2. Start collapsing a couple or ALL functions or objects so you see all 500 lines or so reduced to about the appearance of 50 lines.\r\n3. Start messing with the code a bit, for me things start getting sketchy where some lines are longer than the IDE is interpreting. Meaning I click my mouse cursor at the end of a line, but the IDE will only let me move the keyboard cursor to somewhere in between the end of the line and the front and will only let me move to the next line and not the remainder of that line. This is fixed by editing the line a bit. (Shown here: https://gfycat.com/IllinformedFemaleBubblefish)\r\n4.

Anonymous nodes are selected with a different syntax in the grammar files so it's useful to know.\r\n\r\nAlso some nodes like `>` are not escaped in the notification so it starts a markdown quote.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1058982/48225677-c5a38a00-e39d-11e8-868d-4229f3ef3a09.png)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open an untitled tab in Atom\r\n2. Change the language mode to `c++`\r\n3. Enter the following contents\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate <class myType>\r\nmyType GetMax (myType a, myType b) {\r\n return (a>b?a:b);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Place the cursor in front of a `>` character for example on the first line.\r\n5. Run `editor:log-cursor-syntax-tree-scope`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The last line in the notification to be `\">\"` instead of a markdown quote.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1058982/48225677-c5a38a00-e39d-11e8-868d-4229f3ef3a09.png)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/pull/18411/commits/32d632ba9e8c35bae83f516c09ab2dcd6f67e11d\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nNo"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18405","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18405/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18405/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18405/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18405","id":378617880,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzg2MTc4ODA=","number":18405,"title":"Alt+LMB (Left Mouse Button) double click for subword selection","user":{"login":"AlexWayfer","id":6510020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTAwMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6510020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWayfer","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexWayfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWayfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWayfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWayfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWayfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWayfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWayfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWayfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWayfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWayfer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-11-08T08:02:28Z","updated_at":"2018-11-16T06:54:44Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"## Summary\r\n\r\nAlt+LMB (Left Mouse Button) double click for subword selection.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nYou can select words via `ctrl-left` and `ctrl-right`, also subwords via `alt-`. And you can select words via mouse by double click, but you can't select subwords via mouse.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI saw #2306, but it's about single click, as I understood.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it can be configurable (I don't need for suggested selection there).\r\n\r\nFor now I don't see something (`lmb`, `mouse`, `click`) with mouse in Keybindings Settings.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nIt's very handy for snake_cased syntax, like Ruby, without `_` in Non Word Characters. I think for camelCased it's also handy.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18402","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18402/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18402/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18402/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18402","id":377899369,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzc4OTkzNjk=","number":18402,"title":"Uncaught

These should be colored differently from other variables.\r\n\r\nLooks like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1058982/47872871-07698900-de10-11e8-9c43-5c3a2afdfa28.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n* Different color. I just picked one at random that was already defined. Ideas for a color is welcome.\r\n* Move this to `base` so it applies to every language and not just javascript where we have the only `variable.language` with tree-sitter after https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/pull/620 is merged. It's possible we will add more `variable.language` to other languages shortly and they already exist in textmate.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nPeople that disabled tree-sitter likes the red color:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1058982/47872833-f28cf580-de0f-11e8-81bc-88ec16f2562d.png)\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\n\r\nI checked that `this` is colored differently with tree-sitter enabled and https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/pull/620 merged\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\n\r\n* Changed the color of language variables in JavaScript to be different from other variables\r\n\r\n/cc: @maxbrunsfeld @simurai "},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18378","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18378/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18378/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18378/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18378","id":376340848,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzYzNDA4NDg=","number":18378,"title":"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined","user":{"login":"JimmyTarr","id":13960981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTYwOTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13960981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimmyTarr","html_url":"https://github.com/JimmyTarr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimmyTarr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimmyTarr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimmyTarr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimmyTarr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimmyTarr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimmyTarr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimmyTarr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimmyTarr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JimmyTarr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98444358,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5ODQ0NDM1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/more-information-needed","name":"more-information-needed","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":211058624,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTEwNTg2MjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2018-11-01T10:44:11Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T20:38:39Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"1.

This was previously developed and tested in the sane-indentation package (> 0.9). Refer to https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/issues/594#issuecomment-420415412\r\n\r\nBy itself this does nothing. The new logic is only used if the language package for the current language contains the necessary configuration (e.g., which scopes to indent on). So this PR goes together with, e.g., https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/pull/608 in language-javascript.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->\r\n\r\nI went through a number of iterations developing this code in the sane-indentation package. I first used the scopes array directly, but found that it only got me so far because it was lacking context. So I switched to this new tree-walk approach. It is more concise and has more context to make indentation decisions on. As reported in https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/issues/594#issuecomment-423780452, I found this enough to implement proper indentation for a variety of languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->\r\n\r\nI have not found any cases where the new indentation logic is worse that the previous, regex based logic. In particular it uses the already-present parse tree from tree-sitter, so it seems faster and more comprehensive.\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\n\r\nI developed this code [over the course of the last two months in the sane-indentation package](https://github.com/chfritz/atom-sane-indentation/commits/master) (which monkey patches the `suggestIndentForBufferRow` function to replace the atom indentation logic with this new logic. As proposed by @maxbrunsfeld (https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/issues/594#issuecomment-420415412), I worked on adding support for other languages besides javascript to make sure the logic is general enough to support various types of languages. As reported in https://github.com/atom/language-javascript/issues/594#issuecomment-423780452, I found this logic sufficient for implementing proper indentation for Javascript (incl. JSX), HTML, Python, C and C++. I have not yet tried others.\r\n\r\nThe most comprehensive test was using this new logic in my every-day development (Javascript, JSX, and HTML) for over a month now.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18318","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18318/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18318/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18318/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18318","id":373615324,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzM2MTUzMjQ=","number":18318,"title":"[Atom 1.32.0] Does not inherit environment variables when launched not from the command line","user":{"login":"jzazo","id":25750092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzUwMDky","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/25750092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzazo","html_url":"https://github.com/jzazo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzazo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzazo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzazo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzazo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzazo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzazo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzazo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzazo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jzazo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1109084408,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDg0NDA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/d%20%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F","name":"d ⬇️","color":"ededed","default":false},{"id":1109083834,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDgzODM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/i%20%E2%AC%86%EF%B8%8F","name":"i ⬆️","color":"d1d1d1","default":false},{"id":97577987,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzU3Nzk4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":418477269,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MTg0NzcyNjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/regression","name":"regression","color":"b60205","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false},{"id":1109083354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDgzMzU0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/v%20%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F","name":"v ⬇️","color":"ededed","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2018-10-24T18:24:05Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T16:53:36Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

This will help avoid issues in the next step\n- [ ] Open `packages/README.md` and perform the following edits:\n  - [ ] Update the second column of the **wrap-guide** row to reflect the new local path for the package:\n    ```\n    [`./wrap-guide`](./wrap-guide)\n    ```\n  - [ ] Delete the following line toward the end of the file:\n    ```\n    [wrap-guide]: https://github.com/atom/wrap-guide\n    ```\n- [ ] Run a full Atom build using `script/build` and verify that there are no unexpected build errors\n- [ ] Commit the migrated package code and any changes to Atom's `package-lock.json` files to your branch using this commit message:\n  ```\n  :arrow_right: Migrate core package 'wrap-guide' into ./packages\n  ```\n\n### Phase 3 - Make sure the package works and send a PR\n\n- [ ] Launch the Atom binary in the `./out` folder and manually verify that the migrated package is working without any obvious issues.  For example, if you're migrating a color theme, turn on that theme to make sure that it changes the editor colors as expected.\n- [ ] Open the Chrome Developer Tools console (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+Option+I</kbd>) and ensure that there are no errors written there.  If there are, add them to this issue and investigate.\n- [ ] Create a PR against `atom/atom` with the title \"➡ Migrate core package 'wrap-guide' into ./packages\".  For convenience, you may use the following message in your PR body:\n  ```\n  ### Description of the Change\n\n  This PR migrates the core [`wrap-guide`](https://github.com/atom/wrap-guide) package into `atom/atom`.  See issue #18286 for more information.\n  ```\n- [ ] If any CI tests fail, investigate and fix the failures until CI goes green\n- [ ] Once CI is clean and the PR is approved, merge it\n\n### Phase 4 - Archive the [`wrap-guide`](https://github.com/atom/wrap-guide) repo\n\n- [ ] Move all existing issues from the  [`wrap-guide`](https://github.com/atom/wrap-guide) repo to `atom/atom` using [github-issue-mover](https://github-issue-mover.appspot.com/) or a script\n- [ ] Add a label titled `packages/wrap-guide` to the migrated issues so that they can be found easily\n- [ ] Edit the original package repo's README.md (don't commit directly) to point contributors to the code's new home in `atom/atom`.  You can use the following text:\n  ```\n  ### This package is now a part of the [core Atom repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/wrap-guide), please direct all issues and pull requests there in the future!\n\n  ---\n  ```\n- [ ] Send a PR to the [`wrap-guide`](https://github.com/atom/wrap-guide) repository with the updated README.md so that watchers will be notified of the change.  You do not need to wait for reviews, it can be merged immediately.

This will help avoid issues in the next step\n- [ ] Open `packages/README.md` and perform the following edits:\n  - [ ] Update the second column of the **status-bar** row to reflect the new local path for the package:\n    ```\n    [`./status-bar`](./status-bar)\n    ```\n  - [ ] Delete the following line toward the end of the file:\n    ```\n    [status-bar]: https://github.com/atom/status-bar\n    ```\n- [ ] Run a full Atom build using `script/build` and verify that there are no unexpected build errors\n- [ ] Commit the migrated package code and any changes to Atom's `package-lock.json` files to your branch using this commit message:\n  ```\n  :arrow_right: Migrate core package 'status-bar' into ./packages\n  ```\n\n### Phase 3 - Make sure the package works and send a PR\n\n- [ ] Launch the Atom binary in the `./out` folder and manually verify that the migrated package is working without any obvious issues.  For example, if you're migrating a color theme, turn on that theme to make sure that it changes the editor colors as expected.\n- [ ] Open the Chrome Developer Tools console (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+Option+I</kbd>) and ensure that there are no errors written there.  If there are, add them to this issue and investigate.\n- [ ] Create a PR against `atom/atom` with the title \"➡ Migrate core package 'status-bar' into ./packages\".  For convenience, you may use the following message in your PR body:\n  ```\n  ### Description of the Change\n\n  This PR migrates the core [`status-bar`](https://github.com/atom/status-bar) package into `atom/atom`.  See issue #18282 for more information.\n  ```\n- [ ] If any CI tests fail, investigate and fix the failures until CI goes green\n- [ ] Once CI is clean and the PR is approved, merge it\n\n### Phase 4 - Archive the [`status-bar`](https://github.com/atom/status-bar) repo\n\n- [ ] Move all existing issues from the  [`status-bar`](https://github.com/atom/status-bar) repo to `atom/atom` using [github-issue-mover](https://github-issue-mover.appspot.com/) or a script\n- [ ] Add a label titled `packages/status-bar` to the migrated issues so that they can be found easily\n- [ ] Edit the original package repo's README.md (don't commit directly) to point contributors to the code's new home in `atom/atom`.  You can use the following text:\n  ```\n  ### This package is now a part of the [core Atom repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/status-bar), please direct all issues and pull requests there in the future!\n\n  ---\n  ```\n- [ ] Send a PR to the [`status-bar`](https://github.com/atom/status-bar) repository with the updated README.md so that watchers will be notified of the change.  You do not need to wait for reviews, it can be merged immediately.  You can use the following PR description text:\n  ```\n  As of **INSERT MIGRATION PR LINK**, the `status-bar` package is now a part of the core Atom repository.

For example, if you're migrating a color theme, turn on that theme to make sure that it changes the editor colors as expected.\n- [ ] Open the Chrome Developer Tools console (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+Option+I</kbd>) and ensure that there are no errors written there.

<kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>\r\n2. enter `js`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nE.g. if I enter `js` I would expect Java Script to be the first result since it's an exact abbreviation. I would expect this for other abbreviations too.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nI get the following grammars:\r\n1. `JSON`\r\n2. `JSDoc`\r\n3. `JSON (Twig)`\r\n4. `Java Properties`\r\n5. `Javascript (Twig)`\r\n6. `JUnit Test Report`\r\n7. `JavaScript`\r\n\r\nI could understand if it were on the 4th place since the 1st to 3rd places match on the beginning.\r\nHowever I would prefer if abbreviations would be rated just a little less then a full match.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n`$ atom --version`\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.23.1\r\nElectron: 1.6.15\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n`$  apm --version`\r\n```\r\napm  1.18.11\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.23.1\r\npython 3.6.4\r\ngit 2.15.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n `$ uname -a`  (OS)\r\n```\r\nLinux arch-pc 4.14.10-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Dec 29 20:17:35 UTC 2017 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n```\r\n  \n\n_Copied from original issue: atom/grammar-selector#53_"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18259","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18259/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18259/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18259/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18259","id":371636075,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNzE2MzYwNzU=","number":18259,"title":"Show each grammar's responsible package & link to its settings","user":{"login":"maxbrunsfeld","id":326587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjU4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/326587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maxbrunsfeld/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":1096127806,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDk2MTI3ODA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/packages/grammar-selector","name":"packages/grammar-selector","color":"f4f19c","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-10-18T17:36:28Z","updated_at":"2018-10-18T17:46:32Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"_From @saizai on April 17, 2018 11:21_\n\nSometimes multiple packages provide very similar (or identically named) items.

To define breakpoints or code cells, it supports a custom syntax inside line comments motivated by IDEs like Spyder or Matlab.\r\nIt would be great to be able to highlight these breakpoints in all tree sitter languages.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nCurrently this is easily possible using legacy first mate grammars. We ship a small custom grammar with hydrogen to support the highlighting in a language agnostic way:\r\n\r\n```cson\r\n'scopeName': 'hydrogen.breakpoints'\r\n'name': 'Hydrogen breakpoints'\r\n'injectionSelector': 'comment.line'\r\n'patterns': [\r\n  {\r\n    'match': '%%| %%| <codecell>| In\\\\[[0-9 ]*\\\\]:?'\r\n    'name': 'entity.name.section.breakpoint'\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTree sitter grammars solved some long standing issue we were having due to incorrect code folding. It would be excellent if we could still support highlighting in of custom selectors inside comment strings. Currently injections seam to be only possible for a specific language.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18186","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18186/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18186/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18186/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18186","id":366340994,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjYzNDA5OTQ=","number":18186,"title":"Starting Atom from a folder containing a directory named 'package.json' causes a crash","user":{"login":"building39","id":875327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTMyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/875327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/building39","html_url":"https://github.com/building39","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/building39/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/building39/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/building39/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/building39/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/building39/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/building39/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/building39/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/building39/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/building39/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1109084087,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDg0MDg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/d%20%E2%AC%86%EF%B8%8F","name":"d ⬆️","color":"d1d1d1","default":false},{"id":1109083834,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDgzODM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/i%20%E2%AC%86%EF%B8%8F","name":"i ⬆️","color":"d1d1d1","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false},{"id":1109083354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDgzMzU0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/v%20%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F","name":"v ⬇️","color":"ededed","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2018-10-03T13:33:03Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T18:11:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I've just installed the latest update, which came to me via an alert in atom.

For example, the following text:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=(\\alph*)]\r\n    \\item{\r\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, nisl odio amet, et tempor netus neque at at blandit, vel vestibulum libero dolor, semper lobortis ligula praesent. Eget condimentum integer, porta sagittis nam, fusce vitae a vitae augue. Nec semper quis sed ut, est porttitor praesent. Nisl velit quam dolore velit quam, elementum neque pellentesque pulvinar et vestibulum.\r\n    }\r\n\\end{enumerate}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould be wrapped to\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=(\\alph*)] \\item{ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, nisl odio\r\namet, et tempor netus neque at at blandit, vel vestibulum libero dolor, semper\r\nlobortis ligula praesent. Eget condimentum integer, porta sagittis nam, fusce\r\nvitae a vitae augue. Nec semper quis sed ut, est porttitor praesent. Nisl velit\r\nquam dolore velit quam, elementum neque pellentesque pulvinar et vestibulum. }\r\n\\end{enumerate}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas the expected result is\r\n\r\n```\r\n\\begin{enumerate}[label=(\\alph*)]\r\n    \\item{\r\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, nisl odio amet, et tempor netus neque at at\r\n        blandit, vel vestibulum libero dolor, semper lobortis ligula praesent.\r\n        Eget condimentum integer, porta sagittis nam, fusce vitae a vitae augue.\r\n        Nec semper quis sed ut, est porttitor praesent. Nisl velit quam dolore\r\n        velit quam, elementum neque pellentesque pulvinar et vestibulum.\r\n    }\r\n\\end{enumerate}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the wrapping algorithm such that lines at the beginning and end of each paragraph that resemble LaTeX tags would be ignored for the purpose of wrapping. At the end of the wrapping process, they would be reproduced verbatim. This results in the expected result shown above.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds 3 test cases in `spec/autoflow-spec.coffee` that demonstrate and test the expected behavior.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe main drawback is the potential of non-LaTeX-tags being mis-detected as LaTeX tags, and therefore ignored from the wrapping process. To minimize this risk, the matching regular expressions are written to match the whole line using `/^...$/g` instead of any part of the line.\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\n\r\n- Added unit tests.\r\n- Ran the entire `autoflow` test suite.\r\n- Quick manual test on a LaTeX file and verified the expected behavior."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18150","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18150/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18150/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18150/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18150","id":364970875,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjQ5NzA4NzU=","number":18150,"title":"grammar

Instead of reporting the exception to bugsnag, the package logs an error to the console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError reporting uncaught exception TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of null\r\n    at Reporter.normalizePath (~/github/exception-reporting/lib/reporter.js:71:27)\r\n    at Reporter.scrubPath (~/github/exception-reporting/lib/reporter.js:77:31)\r\n    at ~/github/exception-reporting/lib/reporter.js:61:20\r\n    at Array.map (native)\r\n    at Reporter.buildStackTraceJSON (~/github/exception-reporting/lib/reporter.js:59:40)\r\n    at Reporter.buildExceptionJSON (~/github/exception-reporting/lib/reporter.js:54:24)\r\n    at Reporter.buildNotificationJSON (~/github/exception-reporting/lib/reporter.js:33:27)\r\n    at Reporter.reportUncaughtException (~/github/exception-reporting/lib/reporter.js:229:30)\r\n    at ~/github/atom/out/app/node_modules/exception-reporting/lib/main.js:25:23\r\n    at Function.module.exports.Emitter.simpleDispatch (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/event-kit/lib/emitter.js:25:20)\r\n    at Emitter.module.exports.Emitter.emit (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/event-kit/lib/emitter.js:141:34)\r\n    at window.onerror (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/atom-environment.js:949:26)\r\n    at KeymapManager.module.exports.KeymapManager.dispatchCommandEvent (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/atom-keymap/lib/keymap-manager.js:621:22)\r\n    at KeymapManager.module.exports.KeymapManager.handleKeyboardEvent (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/atom-keymap/lib/keymap-manager.js:412:28)\r\n    at WindowEventHandler.handleDocumentKeyEvent (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/window-event-handler.js:110:40)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository for another bundled package and `apm link` it. We'll use fuzzy-finder for this example:\r\n    1. `git clone atom/fuzzy-finder`\r\n    1. `cd fuzzy-finder`\r\n    1. `git checkout v1.8.1`\r\n    1. `apm install && apm link`\r\n1. In the fuzzy-finder code, edit `main.js` to trigger an error that has a core JavaScript API in the stacktrace:\r\n    ```diff\r\n    --- a/lib/main.js\r\n    +++ b/lib/main.js\r\n    @@ -78,6 +78,8 @@ module.exports = {\r\n       },\r\n\r\n       createProjectView () {\r\n    +    [0].forEach(() => { throw new Error('whoops') })\r\n    +\r\n         this.stopLoadPathsTask()\r\n\r\n         if (this.projectView == null) {\r\n    ```\r\n1. Clone the atom/exception-reporting repository and `apm link` the package:\r\n    1. `git clone atom/exception-reporting`\r\n    1. `cd exception-reporting`\r\n    1. `git checkout v0.43.1`\r\n    1. `apm install && apm link`\r\n1. In the exception-reporting code, edit `lib/reporter.js` so that it will treat our local copy of fuzzy-finder as a bundled package for error reporting purposes:\r\n    ```diff\r\n    --- a/lib/reporter.js\r\n    +++ b/lib/reporter.js\r\n    @@ -253,7 +253,7 @@ export default class Reporter {\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       isBundledFile (fileName) {\r\n    -    return this.normalizePath(fileName).indexOf(this.resourcePath) === 0\r\n    +    return true\r\n       }\r\n\r\n       isTeletypeFile (fileName) {\r\n    ```\r\n1.

It looks for a full Atom build in the `./out` and then serves that to Atom when Atom is launched with a special `ATOM_UPDATE_URL_PREFIX` environment variable that causes update checks to be sent to the local server.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nOne can already test upgrades using a local build of atom.io, but that's a pretty heavy requirement if one only needs to test Atom's update checks.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nOne drawback in the short term is that current Atom releases do not look for the `ATOM_UPDATE_URL_PREFIX` environment variable to override the update URL so one will either need to test with Nightly builds (after this merges) or make a build of Atom stable or beta that includes this change.\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\n\r\n- [x] Built an update on Windows, used the update server to successfully upgrade Atom\r\n- [x] Built an update on macOS, used the update server to successfully upgrade Atom\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18111","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18111/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18111/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18111/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18111","id":363968506,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNjM5Njg1MDY=","number":18111,"title":"Mojave Dark Mode title bar","user":{"login":"dapetcu21","id":428060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODA2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/428060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dapetcu21","html_url":"https://github.com/dapetcu21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dapetcu21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dapetcu21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dapetcu21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dapetcu21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dapetcu21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dapetcu21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dapetcu21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dapetcu21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dapetcu21/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2018-09-26T10:50:52Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T04:35:40Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

So, I have `editor.preferredLineLength` set to `80`.\n\nBut for Git commit messages, [72 characters is a better choice](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html). To help me stick to that guideline, I have a [custom `wrap-guide` setting](https://github.com/atom/wrap-guide/blob/4ffdee199951398f5953fe575dfa3c777e0cdbc0/docs/index.md#configuration) for commit messages:\n\n``` cson\n'wrap-guide':\n  'columns': [\n    {\n      'pattern': 'COMMIT_EDITMSG'\n      'column': 72\n    }\n```\n\nI'd love to be able to reflow a commit message to 72 characters. Currently, when you reflow a paragraph, it uses `editor.preferredLineLength` to determine the line length.\n\nThe gif below demonstrates the current behavior. Note the wrap-guide at 72 characters, and the reflow wrap at 80 characters:\n\n![autoflow-demo](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2988/1812282/7fce0bba-6e75-11e3-86cc-0daca6ed4b33.gif)\n\nIn my case, the commit message gets reflowed at 80 characters instead of 72. It would be awesome if it wrapped at 72 characters.\n\n---\n\nNote: I'm not sure whether we would want the autoflow package to have a dependency on the wrap-guide package. (Seems kinda weird.) Maybe these two packages should be combined?\n\n\n_Copied from original issue:

Here are a few misbehaviors of Autoflow in LaTeX. (Here I am defining the “correct” behavior as that of Sublime Text’s [LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools) package, which is what I’m used to.)\n1. **Autoflow does not respect that lines beginning with a LaTeX command usually should not be reformatted.**\n   \n   Input (the pipe represents where my cursor when I hit `alt+cmd+q`; no text is highlighted):\n   \n   ```\n   \\section{Introduction}\n   |This is the\n   introduction paragraph.\n   ```\n   \n   Expected output:\n   \n   ```\n   \\section{Introduction}\n   This is the introduction paragraph.\n   ```\n   \n   Actual output:\n   \n   ```\n   \\section{Introduction} This is the introduction paragraph.\n   ```\n   \n   I think the rule that Sublime’s LaTeXTools uses is that if a line begins with `\\` it is not reformatted.\n2. **Autoflow does not fully respect LaTeX comments (I).** This is pointed out in #12. Although comments are not treated as normal text like the `\\section` command is in the first example, Autoflow does not correctly insert a symbol `%` upon reformatting.\n   \n   Input (the pipe represents where my cursor when I hit `alt+cmd+q`; no text is highlighted):\n   \n   ```\n   \\section{Introduction}\n   |% In this section the subject is introduced. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, adipiscing elit.\n   ```\n   \n   Expected output:\n   \n   ```\n   \\section{Introduction}\n   % In this section the subject is introduced. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n   % adipiscing elit.\n   ```\n   \n   Actual output:\n   \n   ```\n   \\section{Introduction}\n   % In this section the subject is introduced. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n   adipiscing elit.\n   ```\n3. **Autoflow does not fully respect LaTeX comments (II).** Similarly to above, Autoflow does not remove a `%` when it merges two comment lines.\n   \n   Input (the pipe represents where my cursor when I hit `alt+cmd+q`; no text is highlighted):\n   \n   ```\n   \\section{Introduction}\n   |% In this section\n   % the subject is introduced.\n   ```\n   \n   Expected output:\n   \n   ```\n   \\section{Introduction}\n   % In this section the subject is introduced.\n   ```\n   \n   Actual output:\n   \n   ```\n   \\section{Introduction}\n   % In this section % the subject is introduced.\n   ```\n\n\n_Copied from original issue: atom/autoflow#18_"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18028","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18028/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18028/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/18028/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/18028","id":359218095,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTkyMTgwOTU=","number":18028,"title":"Cursor moves to end of paragraph after reflow","user":{"login":"daviwil","id":79405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/79405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil","html_url":"https://github.com/daviwil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":1053558551,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzNTU4NTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/packages/autoflow","name":"packages/autoflow","color":"f4f19c","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-09-11T20:49:11Z","updated_at":"2018-09-11T21:14:18Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"_From @ithinkihaveacat on March 15, 2015 14:46_\n\nAfter a reflow, the cursor moves to the very end of the paragraph.

You can configure [settings](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/EditorConfig-Properties) for a whole project, a directory, or specific files matched using globbing patterns, with rules set in standard INI format.\r\n\r\nIn particular, I think it would be helpful if Autoflow followed the `max_line_length` directive, which defines what *should* be the maximum number of characters per line. EditorConfig currently only uses the value here to set the placement of a visual text wrapping guide --- i.e., a *hint*, rather than forcing hard-wrap. However, I think \"maximum line length\" is semantically related enough that it would make sense for Autoflow to use this directive when determining how to rewrap text in the current context.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n* Fedora 25 Workstation x86_64\r\n* Atom 1.15.0\r\n* Autoflow 0.29.0\r\n* Electron 1.3.13\r\n* Chrome 52.0.2743.82\r\n* Node 6.5.0\r\n* apm  1.13.0\r\n* npm

The first time I click from the `About` package - this closes the Atom's window but keeps the application running. Then I have to click \"Restart and install...\" from the menubar to actually update Atom.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom\r\n1. Wait for an update\r\n1. From the `About` package, click \"Restart and install\"\r\n1. Observe Atom window closing but Atom app still running in foreground\r\n1. From the menubar, click \"Restart and install...\" again\r\n1.

I'll keep adding more when something comes to mind. Also feel free to comment below, but keep in mind that this issue is not meant to brainstorm solutions and only focuses on the problems first. If we want to improve something, an RFC should be proposed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Can't quickly switch projects\r\n\r\nWhen wanting to switch to another project, Atom opens a new window which takes a while. And you also have to close the current window. Also, the new window size and placement could be different and might need adjustment. \r\n\r\n**Workaround**:\r\n\r\n- You could re-use the same window by removing and adding root folders in the tree-view, but that feels tedious.\r\n- Use packages like [project-plus](https://atom.io/packages/project-plus), [project-jump](https://atom.io/packages/project-jump), [project-switcher2](https://atom.io/packages/project-switcher2)\r\n\r\n## No way to limit the scope to a single root project\r\n\r\nWhen having multiple root projects, find and replace or fuzzy finder always search in all projects. But sometimes you might want some projects not to be \"active\" and just use as reference. Similar issue: [https://github.com/atom/github/issues/1676](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/1676)\r\n\r\n**Workaround**: Temporarily remove and then after the search, add the removed projects back again.\r\n\r\n## Autocomplete is not auto enough\r\n\r\nWhen Autocomplete shows several options, the order is chronological. If the option you want is not near the top, you have to spell it out or use the arrow key many times.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**: None.\r\n\r\n## Slow settings for Packages/Themes and Updates\r\n\r\nIt usually takes several seconds until the list of packages/themes is shown. Or when showing in the Status Bar that there are new updates available, it still takes a long time until the updates show up in the settings.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**: Install [package-settings](https://atom.io/packages/package-settings) to open a package's settings directly.\r\n\r\n## Package discovery is hard to find in the settings\r\n\r\nPeople instinctively go to `Settings > Packages` and then start to type to search for a package, not realizing that they have to go to `Settings > Install`. This came up in the past https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/825, but hasn't gotten enough priority.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**: Use `apm install package-name`.\r\n\r\n## It's hard to know the health of a package\r\n\r\nThere are many packages that are abandoned and not maintained anymore. They are either broken or have bugs that make it less usable. But it's hard to know before installing a package and trying it out.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**: Go to the repo to check a package's \"health\".\r\n\r\n## Command palette could get over-polluted.\r\n\r\nBecause there are quite a few commands, more when installing a lot of packages, it becomes hard to use commands without spelling them out.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**: Remove packages so they don't pollute the list, use a keymap or install the [tool-bar](https://atom.io/packages/tool-bar) package.\r\n\r\n## Some functionality is hard to discover\r\n\r\nFor example the GitHub package has a dock item with current and open PRs, but it's hard to discover that this exists. See this [issue](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/1573)\r\n\r\n**Workaround:**\r\n\r\n- Look through `Menu > Packages`\r\n- Look through command palette\r\n- Package authors could add a button to the Status Bar, although the Status Bar shouldn't be (mis-)used as a navigation\r\n\r\n## Package authors need to build their own UI\r\n\r\nAtom provides some UI components like select-list, tooltip, mini-editor and there are also some CSS-only components in the [Styleguide](https://github.com/atom/styleguide/) like button, checkbox, inputs etc. But otherwise package authors need to build everything themselves. It's great to have the freedom, but it's also a lot of extra work and consistency lacks between all the packages.\r\n\r\n**Workaround**: Package authors could use a 3rd party UI library.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17971","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17971/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17971/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17971/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17971","id":356532144,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTY1MzIxNDQ=","number":17971,"title":"Installing grammars that use Tree-sitter","user":{"login":"Aerijo","id":22167388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTY3Mzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/22167388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aerijo","html_url":"https://github.com/Aerijo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aerijo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aerijo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aerijo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aerijo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aerijo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aerijo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aerijo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aerijo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aerijo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":809817233,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MDk4MTcyMzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/tree-sitter","name":"tree-sitter","color":"bdffaa","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2018-09-03T14:44:24Z","updated_at":"2018-09-07T17:50:01Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPackages that use Tree-sitter currently rely on native build tools on the users machine. This may be common on a developers computer, but should not be assumed. See https://github.com/Aerijo/language-latex2e/issues/17 for an issue that was raised on my package because of this.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Python 2 may not be installed, or `python` may be pointing to Python 3. Both of these will break node-gyp.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Make a fresh Windows VM\r\n2. Install Atom\r\n3. Install a package that depends on a tree-sitter module (e.g., [language-latex2e](https://atom.io/packages/language-latex2e))\r\n4. Get error\r\n5. Attempt to install relevant tools by following [these steps](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#option-2) (I was trying to avoid Admin privileges, or installing `npm` seperately. It may be possible to configure the bundled `npm` to run Option 1 though).\r\n6. Get `MSB4132: The tools version \"2.0\" is unrecognised. Available tool versions are \"12.0\", \"4.`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"768\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-09-04 at 12 34 16 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22167388/44992349-58a8f800-afda-11e8-98d8-c3382e6b750f.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nEither it works without issue, or notifies the user that certain build tools are required & either offers to install them, or links to detailed steps to do it manually.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nAn error is thrown. Exactly what error depends on how much the user has installed. Fresh Windows throws that Python 2 is missing, installing that throws something about missing build tools, installing version 2.0 / 4.0 / 12.0 of something, etc.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom 1.30.0\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n- [More on MSB4132](https://github.com/chjj/pty.js/issues/60)\r\n\r\n- The specific error is not the point of this issue. The issue is that it's possible to get an error at all.\r\n\r\n- The Python issue is probably easier to fix \r\n\r\n- Avoiding Administrator privileges is also highly desirable. Many users will not have this, and installing these tools could be impossible / extremely difficult.\r\n\r\n- There may also be issues with spaces in user names. I haven't tried it with this particular issue though.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17970","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17970/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17970/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17970/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17970","id":356439483,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTY0Mzk0ODM=","number":17970,"title":"Editor Failing to Open","user":{"login":"Thermixia","id":42569225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTY5MjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/42569225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thermixia","html_url":"https://github.com/Thermixia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thermixia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thermixia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thermixia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thermixia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thermixia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thermixia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thermixia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thermixia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Thermixia/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2018-09-03T10:05:50Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T14:34:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAtom background processes starting, but then ending without the editor opening\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Also, as a test, I copied the files to a local folder and open Atom, and it had no problem, and atom still crashes in safe mode when opening the folder, so it's not the packages. Simply, Atom can't handle the remote-drive-tunneled connection for some reason, as I can tell.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a tunel (I used putty)\r\n2. Mount the tunnel as a windows drive using a localhost:port callback to the tunneld port (I used expandrive)\r\n3. Open a folder on the drive using Atom.io\r\n4. Atom shows files for about two to twelve seconds, then crashes. \r\n5. Yell at atom repeatedly, expletives recommended.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\nAtom to work\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nAtom does not work, and crashes to white shortly after opening. (Not even developer console can open while in white screen)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n100% of the time in my given setup.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.30.0\r\nElectron: 2.0.5\r\nChrome  : 61.0.3163.100\r\nNode    : 8.9.3\r\napm  1.19.0\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.30.0\r\npython\r\ngit 2.18.0.windows.1\r\nvisual studio\r\nWindows 10 - Enterprise edition - 1803\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you're running.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17934","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17934/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17934/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17934/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/17934","id":354579714,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjExMzA3NjM0","number":17934,"title":"Only update window title from center pane","user":{"login":"sunz7","id":6427843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Mjc4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6427843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunz7","html_url":"https://github.com/sunz7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunz7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunz7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunz7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunz7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunz7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunz7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunz7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunz7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunz7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-08-28T05:47:16Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T16:28:23Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/17934","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/17934","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/17934.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/17934.patch"},"body":"When multiple projects are opened simultaneously, users will see an incorrect title bar when they focus on side panes such as \"Diagnostics\".

It would be nice if Linux also had that. If the update functionality will not be implemented (anytime soon), it would be nice if there's a button that tells you if an update is available - just so you know that your version is outdated. And perhaps also instructions on how to update.\n\nCurrently, you have to check at https://github.com/atom/atom/releases to see if there is a newer version.

reloading an existing window with ⌥⌘I ⌘R, which typically re-opens the window on display 0, regardless of where it was before.\r\n\r\nIt seems to vaguely seek out another place where there's an Atom window—in some cases, switching Mission Control Spaces to do so. It's hard to underscore how irritating this is.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n*Space switching:*\r\n1. Have multiple Spaces\r\n2. Open an Atom window in one space\r\n3. Create or move to another space\r\n4. Open Terminal\r\n5. Run `atom .`\r\n6. Behold! You have been transported back to the space you were trying to escape, a metaphor for the inescapability of oppression in a world of pervasive capitalism.\r\n\r\n*Reloading a window:*\r\n1. Have multiple displays\r\n2. Put Atom on a secondary display\r\n2. Open the dev console (⌥⌘I) \r\n3. Reload window with ⌘R\r\n4. Where is it? Where's the window? *it's a bloody mystery*\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should (re)open windows on the same display and Space that the last key window occupied.\r\n\r\nWhen opening a new window, you can defend the behavior of opening on the same Space as an existing Atom window, provided the Space is visible. Switching Spaces seems always wrong, and is massively disorienting to boot.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** We seem to pick the Space / display with an active Atom window, switching to it if necessary. But sometimes we don't.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** *So* often.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nmacOS High Sierra\r\nAtom    : 1.30.0-dev-a41a345de\r\nElectron: 2.0.4\r\nChrome  : 61.0.3163.100\r\nNode    : 8.9.3\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI suspect we may need to kick this over to Electron; or, it might be inescapable garbage from macOS. Anyway, since we're talking papercuts, I wanted to capture this one."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17874","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17874/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17874/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17874/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17874","id":351361852,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTEzNjE4NTI=","number":17874,"title":"Launching Atom on WSL fails with no window and no error messages","user":{"login":"pwrosa","id":7400761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDA3NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7400761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwrosa","html_url":"https://github.com/pwrosa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwrosa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwrosa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwrosa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwrosa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwrosa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwrosa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwrosa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwrosa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwrosa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":171329633,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzEzMjk2MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":62363277,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjM2MzI3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2018-08-16T20:45:10Z","updated_at":"2018-10-30T12:06:34Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

However, checking tokens would be a lot more work, and we don't get the caching for free like we do with `isCommented()`. Plus, Tree-sitter can give us the corresponding line directly, so this is only needed while TextMate grammars are still widely used.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nIs core mechanic\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nFixes bad auto-indenting with things like\r\n```\r\nclass MyClass {\r\n    public void myMethod() {\r\n        if (true) {\r\n\r\n        // A comment <- originally used as line to align with; now ignored\r\n        } else if (/* type something here */) {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThe check is _slightly_ slower when many comments are present, but only for the very first run. Subsequent runs cache whether lines are commented, so performance is nearly identical to the original.

This removes the need for an Atom developer to go manually create a draft release with a separate internal tool.\r\n\r\nThis change also sets the stage for performing the final publishing steps with VSTS in an automated way.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nNone that I can think of.\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\n\r\n- [x] Verify that a draft release successfully gets created from a simulated release build\r\n\r\nThis is a screenshot of a draft release created as a result of [this build](https://github.visualstudio.com/Atom/_build/results?buildId=4687&_a=summary&view=logs):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79405/44119521-5936b558-9fce-11e8-8589-a276bb3943f4.png)\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Add changelog generation and save changelog from previously published release with the same version"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17858","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17858/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17858/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17858/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17858","id":350370429,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTAzNzA0Mjk=","number":17858,"title":"Permission denied on SAMBA network drive","user":{"login":"TvviNN","id":11836312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODM2MzEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11836312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TvviNN","html_url":"https://github.com/TvviNN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TvviNN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TvviNN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TvviNN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TvviNN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TvviNN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TvviNN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TvviNN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TvviNN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TvviNN/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":192100748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTIxMDA3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/network","name":"network","color":"f7c6c7","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-08-14T10:31:45Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T14:35:40Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

If there are, add them to this issue and investigate.\n- [ ] Update the second column of the **autosave** row in `packages/README.md` to reflect the new local path for the package:\n  ```\n  [`./packages/autosave`](./autosave)\n  ```\n- [ ] Commit the migrated package code and any changes to Atom's `package-lock.json` files to your branch using this commit message:\n  ```\n  :arrow_right: Migrate core package 'autosave' into ./packages\n  ```\n\n### Phase 3 - Make sure the package works and send a PR\n\n- [ ] Run the full suite of Atom tests with `script/test` and verify that they pass locally\n- [ ] If any tests fail, investigate and fix them then commit the fixes to your branch\n- [ ] Create a PR against `atom/atom` to verify that CI passes\n- [ ] Once CI is clean and the PR is approved, merge it\n\n### Phase 4 - Archive the [`autosave`](https://github.com/atom/autosave) repo\n\n- [ ] Move all existing issues from the  [`autosave`](https://github.com/atom/autosave) repo to `atom/atom` using [github-issue-mover](https://github-issue-mover.appspot.com/) or a script\n- [ ] Add a label titled `packages/autosave` to the migrated issues so that they can be found easily\n- [ ] Edit the original package repo's README.md (don't commit directly) to point contributors to the code's new home in `atom/atom`.  You can use the following text:\n  ```\n  ### This package is now a part of the [core Atom repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/autosave), please direct all issues and pull requests there in the future!\n\n  ---\n  ```\n- [ ] Send a PR to the [`autosave`](https://github.com/atom/autosave) repository with the updated README.md so that watchers will be notified of the change.  You do not need to wait for reviews, it can be merged immediately.\n- [ ] Archive the package repository by going to its [Settings page](https://github.com/atom/autosave/settings), scroll down to the \"Danger Zone\" section and click \"Archive this Repository\"\n\nMigration is now complete! :tada:\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17819","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17819/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17819/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17819/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17819","id":349598073,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDk1OTgwNzM=","number":17819,"title":"Upgrade Atom to Electron 3.0","user":{"login":"daviwil","id":79405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/79405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil","html_url":"https://github.com/daviwil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":258255692,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTgyNTU2OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/electron","name":"electron","color":"A5ECFA","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"daviwil","id":79405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/79405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil","html_url":"https://github.com/daviwil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"assignees":[{"login":"daviwil","id":79405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/79405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil","html_url":"https://github.com/daviwil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviwil/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-08-10T17:31:50Z","updated_at":"2018-08-10T20:37:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"This is a tracking issue for getting Atom updated to Electron 3.0.

This is achieved by using a specific app title including the channel name when assigning the \"product name\" during packaging and installer creation.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** I've also added a new `atom.getAppName()` API to `AtomEnvironment` to make it easy to access the channel-qualified app title in the renderer process.  This name probably isn't ideal so I'd be happy to hear opinions on possible alternatives:\r\n\r\n- `getAppTitle()`\r\n- `getAtomTitle()`\r\n- `getTitle()`\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nBased on how Electron apps are packaged on all 3 platforms, this is the only possible approach.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThis affects the release builds and some app code for Atom's release channels.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThe primary benefit is that Atom users on Windows will now be able to install Atom Stable, Atom Beta, and Atom Nightly and then use and update them independently of one another.  A secondary benefit is that now Windows and Linux builds of Atom now reference the correct channel in their title bars (e.g. \"Atom Beta\" or \"Atom Nightly\").\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nThere aren't any real drawbacks or tradeoffs here, but proper verification will be needed to make sure that no regressions are introduced.\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\n\r\n- [x] Ensure that all release channels can be built and installed simultaneously on Windows\r\n  - [x] Atom Stable\r\n  - [x] Atom Beta\r\n  - [x] Atom Nightly\r\n- [x] Ensure that macOS and Linux builds still function correctly with these packaging changes\r\n  - [x] macOS\r\n    - [x] Atom Stable\r\n    - [x] Atom Beta\r\n    - [x] Atom Nightly\r\n  - [x] Linux\r\n    - [x] Atom\r\n    - [x] Atom Beta\r\n    - [x] Atom Nightly\r\n- [x] Existing CI tests pass after added channel-specific Atom title bar strings\r\n- [ ] Updating existing release channels on Windows doesn't cause errors or bad user experience (these updates will be simulated through local testing)\r\n  - [ ] 1.29.0 -> 1.29.1\r\n  - [ ] 1.30.0-beta1 -> 1.30.0-beta2\r\n  - [ ] 1.31.0-nightly5 -> 1.31.0-nightly6\r\n- [ ] Ensure that `atom.cmd`/`apm.cmd` launches the right Atom channel (might need to add `atom-<channel>.cmd` to differentiate)\r\n- [ ] All three Atom icons appear separately on the taskbar when running\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nFixes #9247.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17797","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17797/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17797/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17797/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17797","id":348421872,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDg0MjE4NzI=","number":17797,"title":"Inconsistent Keyboard Shortcut Humanization","user":{"login":"matthewwithanm","id":126263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjI2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/126263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewwithanm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1109084087,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDg0MDg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/d%20%E2%AC%86%EF%B8%8F","name":"d ⬆️","color":"d1d1d1","default":false},{"id":1109083834,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDgzODM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/i%20%E2%AC%86%EF%B8%8F","name":"i ⬆️","color":"d1d1d1","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false},{"id":1109083354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDgzMzU0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/v%20%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F","name":"v ⬇️","color":"ededed","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-08-07T17:44:51Z","updated_at":"2018-11-26T18:45:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description & Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

These little amounts of time add up.\r\n\r\nMost programs I use will position the top of the context menu higher than the mouse cursor if necessary to show all of the menu items and avoid scrolling.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Right click near the bottom of the screen\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nThe context menu comes up showing all menu items instead of the scroll indicator, meaning its top is much higher than the mouse cursor and its bottom is clamped to the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nA very short context menu needing a lot of scrolling comes up\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n100% of the time\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line.

It feels like the font is \"washed out\".\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nGiven a file \"todo.md\" (so language `GitHub Markdown` is active) with the following content:\r\n```markdown\r\n### aaaa a aaa aaaaa aaa aaaa aaaaa\r\n\r\n* aaaaa aaaaa aa aa aaa aaaa aaa aaaaaa a aaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaa aaaa aaa aaaaa aaaa aaaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa_aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\n  * aa aaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaaa aaa a aaaaaaa_\r\n    * a aaaa aa aaaaaa aaa aaa aaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaa aaaa aaaaa'a aaaaa ✓\r\n    * aaa aaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaa aa aaaa aaaaa aaaaaaa aa aaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaa a aaaaaaa aa aaa aaaaaa aa aaaaaa aaaaaXXX\r\n  * aaa aaaaaaaaaaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaaa aaaaaaa aaaaa aaa aaaa aaa aaaaaaaaaaaa aaaa_ aa aaaaaa... (aaaaaaaaa aaaa aaaa aaaaaa aaaaaa)\r\n\r\n### aaaa a aaaa aa aaaaa\r\n\r\n* aaaaaaaa aaaa aaa aaaaa\r\n\r\n### aaaaaaaaaaa\r\n\r\n* a\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy active text editor has the following size:\r\n```js\r\n// $0 = <atom-text-editor>\r\n$0.getBoundingClientRect()\r\nDOMRect = {\r\n  bottom: 792\r\n  height: 767\r\n  left: 301\r\n  right: 1105\r\n  top: 25\r\n  width: 804\r\n  x: 301\r\n  y: 25\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThere are 2 plugins installed, `linter-ui-default` (and `linter` obviously) and `atom-ide-ui` that enhance the text editors gutter (that affects the size of the text editor too):\r\n* left: breakpoints from atom-ide-ui\r\n* center: line number\r\n* right: linter errors\r\n\r\nboth these plugins take up 10px each (so 20 in total) of the gutter.\r\n\r\nInside the text above you can find `XXX`. This is where you have to place the cursor. Before you start typing look at the first heading, because it will change. Now type any character. 2 things happen:\r\n* the character stays on the same line, even though there is barely any place (subjective I know)\r\n* the heading kind of gets \"washed out\"\r\n\r\nI had this problem for a very long time, now I finally found a way to 100% reproduce this.\r\nThe workaround to get the normal font rendering back is to switch to another tab and then back again.\r\nInterestingly after that the editor has scrolled a bit to the right and therefore \"cuts\" the first char of each line.\r\n\r\nHere is a gif that summarizes all these problems. You probably have to open it see all the details.\r\n![error_atom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3003233/42998704-6288c2e8-8c1b-11e8-9b4c-2368b416c2a4.gif)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSry that this is a bit \"complicated\" but I already prepared everything with my official atom release (1.28).\r\nI was able to reproduce this using atom-beta `1.29.0-beta2` in safe mode too!\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** normal font rendering\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** the text is \"washed out\"\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom -v\r\nAtom    : 1.28.2\r\nElectron: 2.0.5\r\nChrome  : 61.0.3163.100\r\nNode    : 8.9.3\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$ apm -v\r\napm  1.19.0\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.28.2\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.15.2\r\n```\r\n```\r\nlinter: 2.2.0\r\nlinter-ui-default: 1.7.1\r\natom-ide-ui: 0.13.0\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17688","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17688/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17688/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17688/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17688","id":341267865,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDEyNjc4NjU=","number":17688,"title":"[Bootstrap] Error: Module version mismatch.

However, it did that by running `env` in that shell and using \\n to split the output into var=value pairs. However, values can contain \\n (e.g. exported bash functions) and such values will break the parsing. The fix is to have the var=value pairs separated by \\0s. GNU's ```env -0``` does that but won't work on Mac or BSD. Instead, we get the same result using a one line POSIX-compliant  ```awk``` script.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nI was going to just use ```env -0``` until I realized that it was GNU-specific.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nIt fixes a bug in core.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nIt fixes and prevents issues where a subprocess is started with an incorrect environment due to multiline environment variables.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nIf ```awk``` corresponds to GNU's ```awk```, it will add AWKLIBPATH and AWKPATH to the environment (with default values) if they don't already exist.\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\n\r\nI modified the existing spec to include multiline values and confirmed it worked.\r\nI also confirmed that multiline values set in .bashrc are actually showing up correctly in process.env after the change was made.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nIssue #17627\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17627","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17627/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17627/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17627/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17627","id":338394971,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzgzOTQ5NzE=","number":17627,"title":"getEnvFromShell() does not handle newlines in environment variables correctly","user":{"login":"brettle","id":118192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODE5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/118192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle","html_url":"https://github.com/brettle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brettle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-07-05T00:33:49Z","updated_at":"2018-07-05T13:46:01Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

It has occurred on at least 3 different machines that I have used, all running either Fedora or CentOS linux. This has happened to me in all versions of Atom since I started using it about a year ago, up to and including 1.27.0. The fact that the behavior is random makes this impossible for me to reproduce reliably. All I know is that I have to be very careful to make sure the file I'm editing has the correct contents in the editor following a branch switch. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this has something to do with performing back-to-back branch switches. When the problem occurs, it's like the editor followed my \"git checkout master\" just fine, but it missed the \"git checkout dev\" at the end, which is supposed to get me back to the file version I had before I stopped to commit changes. Again, this only happens a fraction of the time, but often enough that I can never trust the file contents in front of me after I switch branches."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17621","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17621/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17621/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17621/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17621","id":338220503,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzgyMjA1MDM=","number":17621,"title":"Atom UI Seems to be blurry over all for some reason??","user":{"login":"bhaviljain68","id":40825956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODI1OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/40825956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhaviljain68","html_url":"https://github.com/bhaviljain68","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhaviljain68/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhaviljain68/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhaviljain68/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhaviljain68/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhaviljain68/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhaviljain68/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhaviljain68/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhaviljain68/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bhaviljain68/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-07-04T10:29:07Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T14:53:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Ok so this seems to happen randomly, but more recently its been consistent.\r\nThe Atom UI gets blurry, as you can see in the image.

the issue (version 1.28 downloaded), instead of ever opening a window it just segfaults from the getgo.\r\n\r\nDownloading and installing a fresh copy of the most recent Atom Beta release (1.29.0) does not fix the issue either, same results as above.\r\n\r\nDownloading an installing a fresh copy of Atom 1.27 fixes the problem and I can use Atom again. Checking the versions I noticed electron and node have major version increments from 1.27 to 1.28 I can't help but wonder if the issue is tied into that.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Reopen atom after computer was asleep\r\n2. Attempt to type\r\n3. Restart Atom\r\n4. Attempt to open atom any way possible\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\nAtom not crash on a segfault and allow me to type.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\nAtom throws errors upon typing and then sgfaults after restarting.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\nSo far has happened twice on back to back days. Once the error happens the segfault crash is consistent.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.28.0\r\nElectron: 2.0.3\r\nChrome  : 61.0.3163.100\r\nNode    : 8.9.3\r\n```\r\n```\r\napm  1.19.0\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.28.0\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.15.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nBeta Version tried:\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.29.0-beta0\r\nElectron: 2.0.3\r\nChrome  : 61.0.3163.100\r\nNode    : 8.9.3\r\n```\r\n\r\nLast Working Version:\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.27.2\r\nElectron: 1.7.15\r\nChrome  : 58.0.3029.110\r\nNode    : 7.9.0\r\n```\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nSeems loosely related to #17558 although the *.node file still exists and my antivirus doesn't have anything flagged."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17599","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17599/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17599/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17599/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17599","id":336952605,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzY5NTI2MDU=","number":17599,"title":"Specific Periodic Crashes (every 9.5 mins) on Windows 10","user":{"login":"jlc-christie","id":581275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTI3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/581275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlc-christie","html_url":"https://github.com/jlc-christie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlc-christie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlc-christie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlc-christie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlc-christie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlc-christie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlc-christie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlc-christie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlc-christie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlc-christie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTMxNDUxMjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2018-06-29T10:46:39Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T14:54:33Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

This is similar to 2 previously reported issues but it is not because of a proxy or VPN and this is not on Mac OS X. Also, Atom does not feel 'sluggish' as described in the Mac OS X issue.

If we're interested in a particular feature however, we'll follow up and ask you to submit an RFC to talk about it in more detail.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nAdd an advanced/detailed view to the about screen that adds extra information like what version of electron, chromium, node, v8, etc is being used.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nDoesn't necessarily help in a specific way, I just like knowing what my computer is running, and as a developer myself I like seeing what version of libraries are being used by certain software.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nRight now the only way to know what version is being used is to check github commits, which is a tedious and long task, especially for older versions of Atom.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nJust a nice feature that I think is good to have.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17544","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17544/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17544/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17544/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17544","id":334223118,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzQyMjMxMTg=","number":17544,"title":"MacOS Inconsistent Text Selection shortcuts in save dialog","user":{"login":"mjrodgers","id":1795161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTUxNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1795161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjrodgers","html_url":"https://github.com/mjrodgers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjrodgers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjrodgers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjrodgers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjrodgers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjrodgers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjrodgers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjrodgers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjrodgers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjrodgers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1109084087,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDg0MDg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/d%20%E2%AC%86%EF%B8%8F","name":"d ⬆️","color":"d1d1d1","default":false},{"id":1109084562,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDg0NTYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/i%20%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F","name":"i ⬇️","color":"ededed","default":false},{"id":98445015,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5ODQ0NTAxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":418477269,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MTg0NzcyNjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/regression","name":"regression","color":"b60205","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false},{"id":1109083354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDgzMzU0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/v%20%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F","name":"v ⬇️","color":"ededed","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2018-06-20T19:45:37Z","updated_at":"2018-11-26T18:37:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe standard shortcut for selecting text to the beginning/end of the current word on macOS is Option-Shift-Left/Right (vs. Windows command of Ctrl-Shift-Left/Right). This works like normal in the editor window, but in the Save File dialog the macOS shortcut does not work (the Windows one is active instead).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Test behavior of Option-Shift-Left/Right and Ctrl-Shift-Left/Right in editor window\r\n2. Save the file (or Save As...) so you get the save dialog\r\n3. Compare the behavior here of Option-Shift-Left/Right and Ctrl-Shift-Left/Right \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**  The behavior is expected to be the same in both places (would expect Option-Shift-Left/Right to select to beginning/end of current word and Ctrl-Shift to do nothing).\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** In the save dialog, Option-Shift-Left/Right seems to trigger something as the \"Selection\" menu flashes, but nothing happens to the cursor or selection. Ctrl-Shift-Left/Right does not make the selection menu flash, but does select and move cursor to beginning/end of the current word.  Oddly enough, Option-Left/Right moves the *cursor* to beginning/end of word, but Ctrl-Left/Right does not.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nmacOS 10.13.5\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.27.2\r\nElectron: 1.7.15\r\nChrome  : 58.0.3029.110\r\nNode    : 7.9.0\r\n\r\napm  1.19.0\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.27.2\r\npython 3.6.5\r\ngit 2.15.2"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17529","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17529/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17529/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17529/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/17529","id":333072531,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTk1MzgzMjc0","number":17529,"title":"File -> Open works without open windows","user":{"login":"karevn","id":7992040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTIwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7992040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karevn","html_url":"https://github.com/karevn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karevn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karevn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karevn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karevn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karevn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karevn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karevn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karevn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karevn/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3MjI5NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false},{"id":193722972,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3MjI5NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-testing","name":"needs-testing","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":9,"created_at":"2018-06-17T15:53:21Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T18:49:27Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/17529","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/17529","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/17529.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/17529.patch"},"body":"Currently, Atom only sets up \"File -> Open\" menu handler upon window creation.

When I fold something, the range gets messed up and no longer works reliably until I unfold everything.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open up the Atom developer console\r\n2. Access the `getVisibleRowRange()` of the active editor\r\n3. Fold and unfold lines and watch the range not changing.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** When I fold something, it should increase the range and match the start and end of the editor line count.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** It shows the start and end line count until I fold something, but then stays the same count, while it should increase to match the beginning and ending of the editor lines count.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% of the time. It's probably intended (for earlier versions without code folding), but it should be changed now.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom 1.27.2 x64\r\nWindows 10 x64\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI also tried accessing\r\n```\r\nelement.getFirstVisibleScreenRow()\r\nelement.getLastVisibleScreenRow()\r\n```\r\nbut those commands above will show exactly the same wrong result as `getVisibleRowRange()`.\r\n\r\nOn top, my suggestion would be to maybe leave those function as they are (for backwards compatibility with packages) and add new ones which get all the visible lines (including the folded ones) and show the range reliably.\r\n\r\nI was bugfixing a [package](https://github.com/camel-chased/editor-background) which has this exact issue mentioned above and I haven't found any functions to access all visible lines. Since those functions doesn't respect the folding, when something folds, the package missmatches lines and stuff get weird.\r\n\r\nSee [this](https://github.com/camel-chased/editor-background/blob/35f4d38cb57bf91dc89bb720dc4f72df7460c562/lib/editor-background.coffee#L781) for reference."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17461","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17461/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17461/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17461/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17461","id":329055262,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjkwNTUyNjI=","number":17461,"title":"Make tree sitter parsers run in browsers","user":{"login":"queerviolet","id":7763406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NjM0MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7763406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/queerviolet","html_url":"https://github.com/queerviolet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/queerviolet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/queerviolet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/queerviolet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/queerviolet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/queerviolet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/queerviolet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/queerviolet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/queerviolet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/queerviolet/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":809817233,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MDk4MTcyMzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/tree-sitter","name":"tree-sitter","color":"bdffaa","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-06-04T13:26:54Z","updated_at":"2018-06-04T20:57:08Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"## Summary\r\n\r\nWe want tree sitter to be able to generate parsers that run within browsers.

However, this seemed like the better solution as covers all the edge cases.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\nIt's problematic that users can accidentally create files which can't be edited, moved or deleted. As this may cause much confusion for the average user.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nAtom will no longer be able to create files with restricted names on windows 10 machines.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n1. The drawbacks are slightly more code on each saveAs operation. This makes the operation a touch slower on windows machines, however the greater scheme of things. The performance loss should be negligible.\r\n2. Two new dependencies (os, slash)\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\nSteps to Reproduce the issue\r\n1. In Windows 10, open any directory in Atom\r\n2. In the file tree pane, right-click and select \"New File\"\r\n3. In the field that appears, enter \"Aux.txt\", or any of the other filenames listed above with any file extension, and press Enter\r\n4.

I have noticed that after executing it the open files contents is reset to the state in the integration branch before the merge. Further investigation showed that it is actually a `git pull` of the integration branch that causes the problem.\r\n\r\nI have created a minimal \"model\" of our script that demonstrates the problem on a toy repository: https://github.com/artm/test-atom\r\n\r\nI think it has to do with the file operations that `git pull` performs when replacing files and would thus affect other scenarios where an external software uses the same operations. I don't know exactly which operations or why it is a problem. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. fork the repository (the script executes a `git push`, so simply cloning is not enough)\r\n2. clone the repository\r\n3. `git checkout feature`\r\n4. `atom --safe README.md`\r\n5. edit and commit the `README.md` to the `feature` branch\r\n6. `./repro`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** the `README.md` open in atom contains the changes from step 5\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** `README.md` contains the version from `deploy` branch before merging the `feature`\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line.

The new listener, however, will observe the global config change as desired.\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThis should be in core because recently atom merged a pull request (#16845 ) that allow per-project settings through {:resetProjectSettings}, the project settings layers the global settings by owning higher priority, the corresponding config change listener should be changed cause when user change the layered global settings the listener should be fired correctly.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThis change add a config change listener that can behave correctly.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\n\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nThis situation origins from our packages which is currently developed for per-project settings based on {:resetProjectSettings}, user can have a local config file in current project folder, our package will parse it and apply the config on the current window, our plan is when user changes the settings in global, our package should be disabled temporarily so as to apply the global config setting changes that the user made, so we used {:atom.config.onDidChange} to listen to the behavior, but it didn't work as described above.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17287","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17287/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17287/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17287/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17287","id":320731459,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjA3MzE0NTk=","number":17287,"title":"Delay between save and close file","user":{"login":"Ky6uk","id":46930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/46930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ky6uk","html_url":"https://github.com/Ky6uk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ky6uk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ky6uk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ky6uk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ky6uk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ky6uk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ky6uk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ky6uk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ky6uk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ky6uk/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2018-05-07T09:13:18Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T16:33:54Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to push `Cmd+S` (save file) and immediately push `Cmd+W` (close file) on changed file then atom asks me to save file before a closing it.

exact moment of the crash. (I made a video of that to check, yes.)\r\n\r\nThe IDE itself goes white with this message in the center:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21111643/39460157-52eb47d8-4d01-11e8-8044-ead0a777129b.png)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nThis bug is very easy to reproduce, in fact I never got through the first 5 minutes. \r\n\r\n1. start atom\r\n2. start working in it (do anything)\r\n3. wait 5 minutes at most\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Not crashing.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Crashing.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this bug with every version of Atom (betas included) since  after 1.24.1. Actually I still use 1.24.1 as it works flawlessly and never crashes. I try periodically to update to a newer version - updating or making a standalone portable version, I tried both - with the same result (failure). The version of Atom used in this current report is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.27.0-beta1\r\nElectron: 1.7.11\r\nChrome  : 58.0.3029.110\r\nNode    : 7.9.0\r\n$ apm --version\r\napm  1.18.12\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.24.1\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.14.1.windows.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n```\r\nOS versions:\r\n```\r\nWindows 10 Insider Preview 17134.1 (rs4_release) (and one or two previous IP versions before that)\r\nWindows 10 Version 1803 for x64 (just upgraded a few hours ago)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI use quite a lot of packages, but no matter that I can reproduce the crash with `atom --safe` too. (Actually it crashed after 3-4 secs after start last time I tried.) Anyway I attach the package list.\r\n[package-list.txt](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1962957/package-list.txt)\r\n\r\nAdditional details to add:\r\n1. In the devtools console of Atom I get this message immediately after start:\r\n`<embedded>:22786 'save-session.dataSaveFolder' could not set the default. Attempted default: undefined; Schema: {\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"The folder in which to save project states\"}`\r\n1. I believe that every time the crash occurs, it's when I move the mouse, like it's in a mouseover handler - of course I'm not sure, it's just a hunch.\r\n1. I could report this bug in mid-march, but I thought it's a thing of the actual beta and it'll gone - it seems it chose to stay."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17247","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17247/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17247/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17247/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17247","id":318883056,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTg4ODMwNTY=","number":17247,"title":"Warn if using a git package with an unsupported version of Atom","user":{"login":"UziTech","id":97994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/97994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech","html_url":"https://github.com/UziTech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/UziTech/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODU2NDQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-04-30T13:05:49Z","updated_at":"2018-05-01T19:39:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Atom should at least warn the user that their version of atom is not supported by that package, or wouldn't allow the package to be enabled/updated/installed like with regular community packages.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Reproduce\r\n1.\r\n ```\r\n$ mkdir project\r\n$ ln -s project linktoproject\r\n$ cd linktoproject\r\n$ echo hello > hi.txt\r\n$ atom .\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

Make changes and save\r\n4. go back to first tab and save\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nI should have two views of the same file, with edits propagating to both. `c-p` should open `linktoproject/hi.txt`\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nAtom opens `linktoproject/hi.txt` on click but opens `project/hi.txt` from find file. Atom thinks these are two different files.

Reserved filenames in Windows 10 are as follows:\r\n\r\n- CON\r\n- PRN\r\n- AUX\r\n- NUL\r\n- COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, COM0\r\n- LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, LPT9, LPT0\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. In Windows 10, open any directory in Atom\r\n2. In the file tree pane, right-click and select \"New File\"\r\n3. In the field that appears, enter \"Aux.txt\", or any of the other filenames listed above with any file extension, and press Enter\r\n4. Observe that the newly created file cannot be opened, deleted, renamed, moved, or otherwise meaningfully interacted with\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should throw an error when the user attempts to create a file with a reserved filename, and prohibit the creation of the file\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** A file is created which cannot be deleted without first booting into a different operating system, such as Linux\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n1.25.0 x64 - Windows 10\r\n1.26.0 x64 - Windows 10\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17145","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17145/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17145/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17145/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17145","id":314435500,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTQ0MzU1MDA=","number":17145,"title":"Rapid Window Cycling Results in System Lock Up","user":{"login":"KNNSpeed","id":9886112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4ODYxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9886112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KNNSpeed","html_url":"https://github.com/KNNSpeed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KNNSpeed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KNNSpeed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KNNSpeed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KNNSpeed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KNNSpeed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KNNSpeed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KNNSpeed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KNNSpeed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KNNSpeed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":171329633,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzEzMjk2MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":62363277,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjM2MzI3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-04-15T17:37:21Z","updated_at":"2018-04-16T17:47:16Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Open a file in Atom\r\n2. Copy some code from Atom\r\n* It's been hard to tell just how significant an impact this step actually has\r\n3. Rapidly switch between programs \r\n* I've been using MS Office, mainly Word and Excel, and Chrome, and I've just been rapidly clicking between windows on-screen.\r\n4. System will lock up, and going into and out of standby (S3) makes it respond again\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** None; this shouldn't happen when cycling through windows.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** System locks up. Requires going into and out of standby mode to get the system to respond again. Sometimes when the system comes back up Atom will be closed, but other times it's still open and responding again.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Reliably. It also happens in Atom's Safe Mode.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\napm  1.19.0\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.25.1\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit\r\nvisual studio\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.25.1\r\nElectron: 1.7.11\r\nChrome  : 58.0.3029.110\r\nNode    : 7.9.0\r\n\r\nWindows 10 x64, Insider Build 17133.13 (latest Slow ring)\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nSlowly switching windows seems to mitigate this behavior.

So we should first convert them to absolute paths with cygpath. \r\n\r\nTry it yourself.

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [ ] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen a package writes to the configuration during it's `deactivate` step there is a chance it can cause Atom to wipe the user's settings when Atom is restarted (such as during updating packages).\r\n\r\n![2018-03-31_00-35-59](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/427137/38161341-2b3940a6-3482-11e8-988d-5da8625af9da.gif)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create an empty folder and set the `ATOM_HOME` environment variable to this folder's path\r\n2. Download [settings-wiper.zip](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1865268/settings-wiper.zip), extract it, and run `apm link` from that folder in the environment from step 1\r\n3. Launch Atom, you should get an information notification saying the current value is `0, 0, 0, 0, 0`, as well as Atom's regular first run screens\r\n4. Set the Welcome screen to disabled in order to make it obvious when this bug hits you.\r\n5. Launch \"enough\" Atom windows to trigger this bug on restarting, I found 10 windows to be a good number\r\n6. Close one of the windows and launch a replacement\r\n7. Note that the number increments\r\n8. Open the developer tools and run `atom.restartApplication()` to restart Atom\r\n9. Either the configuration will save and you will simply see an incremented number, or Atom's configuration will reset and you will see all `0`s again, and the Welcome screen will show in all windows\r\n10. If the settings _didn't_ reset, simply run the command again until it does.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom's configuration doesn't get wiped.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom's configuration occasionally gets completely reset.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** This is somewhat hard to tell, initially it was around 80%, but it can take many calls to `atom.restartApplication()` to reproduce this. Atom v1.26.0-beta0 reproduces this more often than Atom v1.25.0 does, but both versions _do_ reproduce this.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.26.0-beta0\r\nElectron: 1.7.11\r\nChrome  : 58.0.3029.110\r\nNode    : 7.9.0\r\napm  1.19.0\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.26.0-beta0\r\npython 2.7.14\r\ngit 2.16.2.windows.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis bug has not been seen to reproduce in Atom v1.24.1.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis is a split out of the remaining part of https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14909.\r\n\r\nThe common packages in all 24 package lists posted to that issue was the following:\r\n```csv\r\n\"package name\", \"min\", \"max\"\r\n\r\n\"busy-signal\",\"1.4.3\",\"\"\r\n\"intentions\",\"1.1.2\",\"1.1.5\"\r\n\"linter\",\"2.2.0\",\"\"\r\n\"linter-ui-default\",\"1.6.2\",\"1.7.1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n`linter-ui-default` has the possibility to call `atom.config.set` during `deactivate`, leading to the guess in https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14909#issuecomment-371251700 that lead to the test package in this issue.\r\n\r\nThe change to writing the configuration file in a single process was made in https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16628."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17053","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17053/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17053/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17053/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17053","id":310039360,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTAwMzkzNjA=","number":17053,"title":"autocomplete suggest box text ghost rendering","user":{"login":"noe132","id":2271900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzE5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2271900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132","html_url":"https://github.com/noe132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":7,"created_at":"2018-03-30T11:02:00Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T15:27:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\nautocomplete suggestion box text rendering issue\r\n\r\nI'm using typescript develop my app using [atom-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript) getting for suggestion. but as I scroll up and down using arrow keys the text rendering in suggestion box looks wierd.\r\nI cannot reproduce this under safemode because I need the atom-typescript package to get suggestion display.\r\nI've try to use default theme but doesn't change something.\r\nI don't know it was related to atom or atom-typescript package, but I think It might be atom rendering issue?\r\n\r\ngif:\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2271900/38135574-8d696cf6-344b-11e8-8f78-680fbdb9d499.gif)\r\nI don't know how to inspect the suggestion box element using dev tools because it close immediatly after i click somewhere else :(\r\n\r\n[Description of the issue]\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. install atom-typescript\r\n2. open some project using typescript\r\n3. get suggeestion by typing something\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%.

Instead, only TextMate grammars are returned.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  // Extended: Get all the grammars in this registry.\r\n  //\r\n  // Returns a non-empty {Array} of {Grammar} instances.\r\n  getGrammars () {\r\n    return this.textmateRegistry.getGrammars()\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes issues with the `grammar-selector` package, which uses that function to build the list of available grammars. All tree-sitter grammars will be hidden from it.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, if a regex grammar has the same `name` value as a tree-sitter one, then the regex grammar will appear in the list, but selecting it will apply the tree-sitter grammar\r\n\r\nThis can be seen by selecting `Python`, and noticing the green tick mark is not applied to it when you reopen the menu (in contrast to a solely regex grammar, with no tree-sitter alternative).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open the grammar menu and select `Python`\r\n2. Open the grammar menu and look at the `Python` entry; there is no tick mark\r\n3. Select `Python Console` (or any other regex-only grammar)\r\n4. Open the grammar menu and see the tick mark next to `Python Console`\r\n\r\nAlternatively, a grammar that is solely tree-sitter based will not appear at all in the selection menu, but will be automatically applied when the right file type is opened.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nTick next to `Python` because it was selected\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nNo tick, because we were actually selecting the regex gramar and the tree-sitter one \"intercepted\" it as it was being applied. So the result is that the regex grammar was _not_ applied, and so no tick mark.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\napm  1.19.0\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.26.0-beta0\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.14.3\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.26.0-beta0\r\nElectron: 1.7.11\r\nChrome  : 58.0.3029.110\r\nNode    : 7.9.0\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.13.3\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17012","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17012/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17012/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17012/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17012","id":307673058,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMDc2NzMwNTg=","number":17012,"title":"Automatic Snapcraft Builds","user":{"login":"nickhagen","id":5169883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjk4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5169883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickhagen","html_url":"https://github.com/nickhagen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickhagen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickhagen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickhagen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickhagen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickhagen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickhagen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickhagen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickhagen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickhagen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":97577987,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzU3Nzk4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2018-03-22T14:42:16Z","updated_at":"2018-03-22T17:38:33Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe official snap package listed on the snapstore always lags the release by up to a week or more:\r\nhttps://snapcraft.io/atom\r\n\r\nThis documentation seems to indicate you can setup an automatic deployment from the Git releases:\r\nhttps://docs.snapcraft.io/build-snaps/ci-integration\r\n\r\nIt appears from your issue tracking that you already have travis-ci working from this repo."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17007","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17007/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17007/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/17007/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/17007","id":307423989,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMDc0MjM5ODk=","number":17007,"title":"awful anti-aliasing and hinting, and no sub-pixel rendering;

Copy-paste the following text into a file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabc\r\ndef\r\nghi\r\nghi\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Use \"Find in project\" with the string `ghi`\r\n\r\n4. Increase the number of leading context rows as much as you can.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The lines `abc` and `def` should be shown as context (and indeed, they are shown above the second result).\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Only `def` is shown.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrent soft-wrapping behavior is not aggressive enough and sometimes leads to bad results.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Enable «Soft Wrap» and «Soft Wrap at Preferred Line Length» in «Editor» tab of Settings\r\n2. Copy an URL in a text editor tab or a sequence of non-spaces characters that have more characters than the Preferred Line Length setting\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\n* Break character sequences on spaces, dashes and slashes, like in a web browser\r\n* Break character sequences at most at the «Preferred Line Length» setting\r\n* Show a grayed out character, like those for EOL or spaces, when Atom break a word that had no spaces in it. Suggestion for default character: broken bar `¦`, which is present in the same Unicode block than  `¤¬»`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if Preferred Line Length is set to 20, then it should behave like this (`|` character represent the wrap-guide):\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com¦ |\r\n/atom/atom/issues¦  |\r\n/new                |\r\n                    |\r\nAverylongword-¦     |\r\nthatshouldbreak     |\r\n                    |\r\nAverylongword-    ¦ |  # four spaces after the dash and we see where it stops\r\nthatshouldbreak     |  # ¦ allows to differentiate with the previous example\r\n                    |\r\nAverylongwordwithnos|¦  # no space, dash or slash in the word\r\neparator            |\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\n* Character sequences break only on spaces\r\n* If the character sequence doesn’t contain space and fill the whole line, the word is cut at the window edge instead of the expected Preferred Line Length (see screenshot).\r\n![screenshot of current work-wrapping behavior](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2446451/37145899-785416b2-22c2-11e8-8229-d8eefa909d57.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/a|tom/atom/issues/new\r\n                    |\r\nAverylongword-thatsh|ouldbreak\r\n                    |\r\nAverylongword-      | # four spaces after the dash but we can’t see it\r\nthatshouldbreak     |\r\n                    |\r\nAverylongwordwithnos|eparator\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nArch Linux\r\nAtom    : 1.24.0\r\nElectron: 1.8.2\r\nChrome  : 59.0.3071.115\r\nNode    : 8.2.1\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16900","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16900/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16900/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16900/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16900","id":303309078,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMDMzMDkwNzg=","number":16900,"title":"Different Panes can have the same id","user":{"login":"matthewwithanm","id":126263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjI2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/126263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewwithanm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwithanm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-03-08T00:16:22Z","updated_at":"2018-04-14T20:50:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Different instances of the Pane class can have the same `id` value.

We won't be able to get away from requiring python 2 entirely, but we can at least accept a python 2 path from `npm config get python` or `${PYTHON}`.\r\n\r\nWithout this in place, even with `${PYTHON}` set to a python2 install, the build for git-utils fails with a python 2/3 compatibility problem. It turns out that the Makefile generated by node-gyp sometimes executes a file with a `#!/usr/bin/env python` shebang line, so unless the python2 binary is actually discoverable on the `${PATH}` as \"python\", the build fails.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThe clearest alternative is to actually fix node-gyp at the source, by porting gyp to Python 3 or JavaScript. That would require getting a patch accepted into gyp, then waiting for it to be included in a node-gyp release, then a node release, then upgrade our build to use that node version.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nIt's where the build is.\r\n\r\nI'm also going to create a parallel pull request for apm to improve our Python detection during apm builds (atom/apm#775).\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nDevelopers who:\r\n\r\n* Use `homebrew` on MacOS and have the `python` formula installed.\r\n* Use Arch Linux or other distributions that use Python 3 as their default `python` package.\r\n\r\n...will be able to build Atom without having to break things on their system that rely on Python 3 being the default. We'll also have a nice message if Python 2 cannot be found.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\n\r\nThe ultimate test is to run `script/build` with Python 3 on the PATH.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n* atom/git-utils#48\r\n* atom/git-utils#72\r\n* atom/apm#698\r\n*

The installer runs with user privilleges, but modifications to this directory requires root privilleges. \r\n\r\nThis issue is a result of code added to install-application.js in PR [15498](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15498)\r\n\r\nThe error has to do with the following code in `atom/script/lib/install-application.js`:\r\n```\r\nconst baseIconThemeDirPath = findBaseIconThemeDirPath()\r\nconst fullIconName = atomExecutableName + '.png'\r\nlet existingIconsFound = false\r\nfs.readdirSync(baseIconThemeDirPath).forEach(size => {\r\n     const iconPath = path.join(baseIconThemeDirPath, size, 'apps', fullIconName)\r\n     if (fs.existsSync(iconPath)) {\r\n          if (!existingIconsFound) {\r\n               console.log(`Removing existing icons from \"${baseIconThemeDirPath}\"`)\r\n          }\r\n          existingIconsFound = true\r\n          fs.removeSync(iconPath)\r\n     }\r\n})\r\n```\r\nSince `baseIconThemeDirPath` is set by the following\r\n```\r\nfunction findBaseIconThemeDirPath () {\r\n     const defaultBaseIconThemeDir = '/usr/share/icons/hicolor'\r\n     const dataDirsString = process.env.XDG_DATA_DIRS\r\n     if (dataDirsString) {\r\n          const dataDirs = dataDirsString.split(path.delimiter)\r\n          if (dataDirs.includes('/usr/share/') || dataDirs.includes('/usr/share')) {\r\n               return defaultBaseIconThemeDir\r\n          } else {\r\n               return path.join(dataDirs[0], 'icons', 'hicolor')\r\n          }\r\n     } else {\r\n          return defaultBaseIconThemeDir\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn particular, since our  `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` is:\r\n```\r\n /usr/share/ubuntu:/usr/share/gnome:/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/:/var/lib/snapd/desktop\r\n```\r\nA  workaround suggested by Spotter (Slack name) which was to change `$XDR_DATA_DIRS` to `~/local/share`. However, this will mess up other applications using this environment variable."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16832","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16832/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16832/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16832/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16832","id":300029037,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTcxMjMxODg5","number":16832,"title":"Add a new keybinding for window:reload Fixes #1794","user":{"login":"CvX","id":66961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/66961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CvX","html_url":"https://github.com/CvX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CvX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CvX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CvX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CvX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CvX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CvX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CvX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CvX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CvX/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-02-25T14:10:36Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T16:47:49Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/16832","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16832","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16832.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16832.patch"},"body":"### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a new (and default) keybinding for \"View/Developer/Reload Window\" that isn't in conflict with 1Password's keybindings.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nN/A?\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nIt's not unreasonable to presume that there's a large percentage of 1Password users among Atom developer community, so it would be beneficial fix this binding clash.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nI've left previous binding in, so users unaffected by this problem won't have to adjust.\r\nIt could conflict with other applications or Atom packages, but I've not experienced any issues.\r\n\r\n### Verification Process\r\n\r\nI've been using both keybindings in my own keymap for a while now.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nIssue #1794 (while closed, the it is still relevant).\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16822","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16822/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16822/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16822/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16822","id":299510230,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTk1MTAyMzA=","number":16822,"title":"Moving lines bug -

Removing one of these two \"ingredients\" is enough to make lines auto-indent correctly. It's just backticks+square bracket combo. Also, comment underneath the lines in the screenshots below doesn't affect anything, it's just to make your visual grep'ping easier.\r\n\r\nHere it is in action:\r\n\r\n![bug1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8344688/36563619-a437476e-1812-11e8-9d4d-c578c05feb4f.gif)\r\n\r\n![bug2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8344688/36563623-a6bab110-1812-11e8-8fd4-f1b2f3b5b5ef.gif)\r\n\r\nThe backticks pattern happens often in ES6+ JavaScript code template literals. It's just enough to put the square bracket somewhere and lines are suddenly off when moved.\r\n\r\nI saw there are different or vague/general issues raised about moving lines and automatic indentation but it seems that **none touch this specific case**. Excuse me if this issue was mentioned somewhere in the comment threads; I searched for this issue as much as reasonably possible and couldn't find any issue mentioning backticks+left square bracket.

For example, on Windows the script for launching Atom handles the fact that Atom is a GUI (Windows Subsystem) application and makes it behave properly with console output, waiting for it to exit, or detaching from the shell. As another example, the script in Linux/Mac is meant for launching from the shell (Not from a `.desktop` file or similar) and handles setting `ATOM_DISABLE_SHELLING_OUT_FOR_ENVIRONMENT` and various other details that are somewhat similar to what is done in Windows.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that there is no visible script for launching `apm` in the Linux/Mac zip/tar packages. You have to dig into `resources\\app\\apm\\bin\\apm` to run it, which is confusing for users not familiar with Atom's internals. I think the deb/rpm packages include a symlink but the zip/tar packages include no such thing.\r\n\r\nI think that for all platforms such scripts should be packaged inside a `bin` folder at the root of the Atom installation. This way they are more visible, and you have a clear directory to add to your `PATH`.\r\n\r\nThe scripts for Windows are here [resources/win](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/resources/win), and the script that is used in Linux/Mac is here [atom.sh](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/atom.sh). apm on Linux/Mac includes it's own scripts and a symlink is created for the non tar/zip packages.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Look at the contents of the portable zip\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** I expect the launcher scripts to be packaged visibility.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** They are packaged inside the resources folder slightly out of view. `apm` on Linux/Mac is hidden deeply.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nWindows 10.0.16299.248 x64\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.24.0\r\nElectron: 1.6.16\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\napm  1.18.12\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.24.0\r\npython 2.7.14\r\ngit 2.16.2.windows.1\r\nvisual studio 2015\r\n```\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16782","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16782/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16782/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16782/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16782","id":298281498,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTgyODE0OTg=","number":16782,"title":"Markdown breaks syntax highlighting and code folding","user":{"login":"vijithassar","id":3488572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODg1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3488572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijithassar","html_url":"https://github.com/vijithassar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijithassar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijithassar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijithassar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijithassar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijithassar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijithassar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijithassar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijithassar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vijithassar/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":809817233,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MDk4MTcyMzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/tree-sitter","name":"tree-sitter","color":"bdffaa","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2018-02-19T13:49:26Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T03:17:49Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nCode folding does not work for Markdown code blocks [as previously reported](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8879) which means Atom is not a good choice for [coding in literate programming style](https://github.com/vijithassar/lit).

(yay) But I notice two issues:\r\n1. Editor scrolling now feels _more_ sensitive than native scrolling, with the default sensitivity.\r\n2. There's some visual jank while scrolling -- much more than in a browser.\r\n\r\nI think (1) is partially caused by [this bit of code](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/7e0635d2c0d4b50cb76e4eccd619ab1041e5c86d/src/text-editor-component.js#L1524), which resolves each scroll delta to a minimum of 1px. Trackpads fire scroll events very often, so unless you're scrolling very quickly, the deltas can easily be less than a pixel, especially after being multiplied by the sensitivity (default 0.4).\r\n\r\nScaling up these small deltas makes scrolling feel weird, because it prevents the trackpad from distinguishing between velocities greater than 0 but less than a certain value. What's the rationale for this scaling? I thought it might be to align everything to a pixel grid, but that doesn't seem for happen for anything larger than 1px.\r\n\r\nAnother factor in (1) is the use of `wheelDelta` over `delta`, introduced in #16114. It seems like on a macOS trackpad, the former is exactly 3x the latter, or 1.2x when multiplied by the default scroll sensitivity (0.4). This makes me think that `delta` is actually the correct value -- the default sensitivity is what's throwing things off. Sure enough, using `delta` with a sensitivity of 1 (or emulating this by setting the sensitivity to 0.33 with the current `wheelDelta` implementation) feels _much_ more natural.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how scrolling works for other platforms, but what's the meaning of the default value \"40\" in the first place? It seems like it should default to 100, and be adjustable by users as a percentage. That would let the scrolling code use `delta` to precisely replicate native scrolling. If that's too hard to change globally, we could at least make \"40\" equivalent to native for wheel scrolling by replacing `wheelDelta * scrollSensitivity` with `delta * (scrollSensitivity / 40) * 100`.\r\n\r\nHappy to PR these changes if you agree with them.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what's causing (2) -- the Atom implementation of scrolling probably just isn't as fast as the native one.\r\n\r\ncc @Ben3eeE @50Wliu @nathansobo\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nOpen an editor window and an Atom settings window in separate tabs, then switch between them while scrolling.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** identical to native scrolling\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** too sensitive, & some jank\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom 1.24.0\r\napm 1.18.12\r\nmacOS 10.13.3\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16739","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16739/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16739/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16739/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16739","id":297147946,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTcxNDc5NDY=","number":16739,"title":"Atom panes push left when switching files or panes","user":{"login":"mirandashort","id":22545566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ1NTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/22545566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirandashort","html_url":"https://github.com/mirandashort","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirandashort/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirandashort/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirandashort/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirandashort/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirandashort/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirandashort/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirandashort/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirandashort/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirandashort/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":19,"created_at":"2018-02-14T15:57:02Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T15:21:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nWhen jumping around files or switching between panes, the editor appears to push the whole UI to the left, removing the tree from view as well as text in the left pane. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22545566/36213447-c1ee9d1a-1174-11e8-9060-7ea56e415f12.png)\r\n\r\nThis does not occur every time, but has been happening more frequently since I first encountered the issue back in January.

I can open Settings and other panels such as Timecop etc.. I have not made any updates to Atom recently; I did run my daily `dnf update` but don't recall any packages of note that came through. I don't remember if this issue began before or after that update. \r\n\r\nPressing Ctrl+n or double-clicking in an open spot on the tab bar does not result in a new, unsaved document opening in a new tab. Ctrl+o brings up the window to browse for a file to open, but double-clicking or selecting \"Open\" fails to open the highlighted file (tried with GFM as well as plain text files).\r\n\r\nNo errors are displayed, Atom just fails to open the new tab/file. Files which are already open when I launch the program can be edited normally, and there are no issues with saving. At no point is Atom unresponsive.\r\n\r\nIf I launch Atom with the --clear-window-state option, then I am able to open existing and new files in the editor as expected, but once I close that session and reopen Atom normally, I am no longer to open files unless I launch it **again** with --clear-window-state, and so on.\r\n\r\nI have attempted reinstalling Atom from the latest .rpm downloaded from atom.io, completely removing and then installing it once more, adding the Fedora repository and installing Atom from there, and even installing the most recent beta, all of which exhibit the same behavior. Even on first launch, with the welcome screen etc. visible, I cannot open a new file.\r\n\r\nI have also removed/renamed the .atom settings folder and disabled all added extensions, as well as run the program in safe mode, and the issue still persists.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom\r\n2. Attempt to open an existing file with Ctrl+o or through the File menu, **or** attempt to open a new, blank file with Ctrl+n or through the file menu\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should open the selected file in a new tab or a blank file in a new tab.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Nothing.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time I open Atom (when not using the --clear-window-state option) since 2018-01-29.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n**Atom 1.23**\r\n`atom --version`\r\nAtom    : 1.23.3\r\nElectron: 1.6.15\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\n`apm --version`\r\napm  1.18.12\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.23.3\r\npython 2.7.14\r\ngit 2.14.3\r\n\r\n**Atom 1.24 beta**\r\n`atom-beta --version`\r\nAtom    : 1.24.0-beta3\r\nElectron: 1.6.15\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\n`apm-beta --version`\r\napm  1.18.12\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.24.0-beta3\r\npython 2.7.14\r\ngit 2.14.3\r\n\r\n\r\nComputer is a Lenovo Thinkpad X230 running Fedora 27 and the i3 window manager.\r\n`uname -a`\r\n\r\n`Linux Unit-03 4.14.14-300.fc27.x86_64 #1 SMP Fri Jan 19 13:19:54 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nNone presently.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16645","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16645/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16645/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16645/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16645","id":292473650,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTI0NzM2NTA=","number":16645,"title":"Unable to open project directory while it's removed","user":{"login":"noe132","id":2271900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzE5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/2271900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132","html_url":"https://github.com/noe132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noe132/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2018-01-29T16:32:59Z","updated_at":"2018-03-11T11:37:55Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Here are examples of the current behavior. \r\n\r\nCurrent Atom's subWord selection moving forward (the \"|\" represents the cursor):\r\n`|this.aMethod`\r\n`this|.aMethod`\r\n`this.|aMethod`\r\n`this.a|Method`\r\n`this.aMethod|`\r\nCurrent Atom's SubWord selection moving backwards (the \"|\" represents the cursor):\r\n`this.aMethod|`\r\n`this.a|Method`\r\n`this.|aMethod`\r\n`this|.aMethod`\r\n`|this.aMethod`\r\n\r\nNow the same example with the proposed behavior:\r\n\r\nProposed Atom's subWord selection moving forward (the \"|\" represents the cursor):\r\n`|this.aMethod`\r\n`this|.aMethod`\r\n`this.a|Method`\r\n`this.aMethod|`\r\nPorpoised Atom's SubWord selection moving backwards (the \"|\" represents the cursor):\r\n`this.aMethod|`\r\n`this.a|Method`\r\n`this.|aMethod`\r\n`|this.aMethod`\r\n\r\nAs it can be seen, the proposed behavior only changes the dot \".\" selection, everything else remains the same.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThe current behavior creates an unnecessary need for an extra input to move across  subwords.\r\nThe current behavior also repeats functionality since the same behavior can be obtained by using just left/right arrow. Example (the \"|\" represents the cursor):\r\nIf the cursor is at the left of a dot and we are moving forward, like shown:\r\n`this|.method`\r\nThen the input alt-right arrow would produce the same output as simply right arrow:\r\n`this.|method`\r\n\r\nThis also happens when selecting text by using shit-alt-arrow.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThis changes makes moving trough subwords faster, but it also is a more natural way of doing it.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nSome user may struggle to accommodate to this change at  first.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nThis issues asked for a change in behavior, however, this change does not supply every change requested in them.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13651\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13953"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16453","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16453/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16453/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16453/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16453","id":284741921,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODQ3NDE5MjE=","number":16453,"title":"Prompt for registering as default atom:// protocol handler is unclear","user":{"login":"carpben","id":13496178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDk2MTc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/13496178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpben","html_url":"https://github.com/carpben","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpben/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpben/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpben/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpben/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpben/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpben/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpben/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpben/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carpben/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODU2NDQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2017-12-27T15:18:00Z","updated_at":"2018-10-14T19:33:22Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Install Atom and make sure you activate `Settings->Core->Automatically Update`\r\n2. Activate `Settings->System->Show in file context menus` and `Settings->System->Show in folder context menus`\r\n3. Check that right-clicking a file or folder in Windows Explorer shows `Open with Atom` entry and that the entry shows Atom's icon.\r\n4. Wait until Atom has updated at least once since it was first installed\r\n5. Right click on a file or folder in Windows Explorer or the desktop\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** An entry named `Open with Atom` shows in the right-click menu, showing the Atom's icon.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** An entry named `Open with Atom` shows, but it doesn't show the icon because it's pointing to an old/removed version, and not to the latest installed updated. Or worse, it points to a previous version which haven't been uninstalled after the auto update. More on this below.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** In my case, 100%, every time Atom autoupdates.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.22.1\r\nElectron: 1.6.15\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\napm  1.18.8\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 3.6.0\r\ngit 2.11.0.windows.1\r\nvisual studio\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Home x64 Version 10.0.16299 Build 16299\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the registry keys like `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\shell\\Atom\\command` and the others needed to implement the right-click system integration for `Open with Atom` doesn't get updated after Atom is updated. For example, right now I have installed Atom version 1.23.1, but the registry keys were pointing to version 1.22.1. Scripts in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\atom\\bin` aren't updated, either, they keep pointing to 1.22.1, not 1.23.1.\r\n\r\nThe registry keys can be fixed by launching Atom and disable and re-enable the checkboxes under `Settings->System`, but the scripts aren't.\r\n\r\nSomething if failing after an automatic update, and the things related to launching Atom doesn't get updated.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask me any additional information you may need, and thanks in advance!\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16413","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16413/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16413/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16413/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16413","id":283525958,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODM1MjU5NTg=","number":16413,"title":"File.onDidRename throws error instead of calling callback function ","user":{"login":"mkungla","id":15878458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODc4NDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15878458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkungla","html_url":"https://github.com/mkungla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkungla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkungla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkungla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkungla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkungla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkungla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkungla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkungla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkungla/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-12-20T11:03:12Z","updated_at":"2017-12-20T21:19:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Click the blue squirrel\r\n2. Click restart and install\r\n3. Atom closes but doesn't quit\r\n4. Wait for a while\r\n5. What's going on? Is it stuck?\r\n5. Force quit\r\n6. Start atom\r\n7. Update failed\r\n8. Repeat\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nAs a user I expect the update process to work as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Click the blue squirrel\r\n2. Click restart and install\r\n3. Atom immediately restarts and shows me a progress bar of the new version downloading and then installing\r\n4. Done\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nSee step to reproduce.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\nAll the time so far.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.23.1\r\nElectron: 1.6.15\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\napm  1.18.11\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.23.1\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.15.1\r\nmacos high sierra 10.13.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI understand that I shouldn't force quit atom while updating, but as a user it's frustrating to not know if it's hanging or actually doing something. Plus, besides that, I've also gotten [this error](https://discuss.atom.io/t/i-am-unable-to-update-to-the-latest-version-of-atom-on-macos-how-do-i-fix-this/40054) and encountered other snags while updating.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the update flow needs some attention. The current flow feels broken, even though it might be working well, as a user you just don't know because there's no indication of what's happening."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16379","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16379/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16379/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16379/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16379","id":281970486,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODE5NzA0ODY=","number":16379,"title":"Windows of a session should be aware of corresponding special tabs","user":{"login":"PointedEars","id":200752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/200752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PointedEars","html_url":"https://github.com/PointedEars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PointedEars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PointedEars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PointedEars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PointedEars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PointedEars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PointedEars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PointedEars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PointedEars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PointedEars/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-12-14T03:29:35Z","updated_at":"2017-12-15T00:24:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n→ **general usability issue**\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n→ **not applicable**\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n→ **search for `welcome` yielded no suitable matches**\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n→ **not a case of missing functionality**\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Start without or with reset configuration (cf. #14909) where “Show Welcome Guide” is enabled and the Anonymous Usage Statistics tab is displayed by default. If you have Nuclide installed, too, Nuclide displays its own “Welcome” tab as well by default.\r\n2. Leave the checkbox in the “Welcome” tab(s) checked and do not reply to the anonymous statistics question.\r\n3. File → “New Window”, or close tab in one window, exit, and restore the session.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** One “Welcome” page and usage statistics question _per session_ unless a different setting says otherwise. At least the setting/decision made in one window of a session should carry over to the other window(s) that has/have the same tab open.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** “Welcome” tab(s) and statistics question tab is/are opened in every (new) Atom _window_, although e.g. the “Welcome Guide” checkbox says “when _opening Atom_”. The questions/tabs must be answered/closed _separately_ in _every_ window, as if they did not belong to the same application.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** _Always_\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.23.1\r\nElectron: 1.6.15\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\n$ apm --version\r\napm  1.18.11\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\natom 1.23.1\r\npython 2.7.12+\r\ngit 2.11.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**OS:** Debian/Devuan GNU+Linux jessie/stretch/sid\r\n\r\n**But: This has probably been an issue since the first versions of Atom (which I used). Last observed with configuration reset in Atom 1.22.1 (see #14909).**\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n#### Installed Packages\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ apm list --installed\r\nCommunity Packages (172)

So we decided to add our function selectCurrentParagrahp() that would use moveToBeginningOfNextParagraph() in way that was able to fully implement the feature as desired.\r\n\r\n![select-current-paragraph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17158229/33673091-c76ceb3c-daa3-11e7-91b7-8b0e5a9e4cdb.gif)\r\n  \r\n  #### Source Files\r\n\r\n  To implement the keybinding ctrl-alt-p and associate it with our function we changed the keymaps files\r\n  * 'keymaps/linux.cson'\r\n  * 'keymaps/win32.cson'\r\n  * 'keymaps/darwin.cson'\r\n\r\n  Implementation of the functions that would make the selection happen\r\n  + 'src/register-default-commands.coffee'\r\n  + 'src/text-editor.js'\r\n  + 'src/selection.js'\r\n\r\n  We added a test of the function\r\n\r\n  + 'spec/text-editor-spec.js'\r\n\r\n  #### Fix Source Code\r\n  We first connected a keybinding to the created handler\r\n  ``` cson\r\n    'ctrl-alt-p': 'editor:select-current-paragraph'\r\n  ```\r\n  Then we associated the handler to the function selectCurrentParagraph()\r\n\r\n  ``` coffeescript\r\n\r\n    'editor:select-current-paragraph': -> @selectCurrentParagraph()\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  After that we created the selectCurrentParagraph function in the TextEditor\r\n\r\n  ``` javascript\r\n    // Extended: Expand selections to the current paragraph.\r\n    // Operates on all selections. Moves the cursor to the       beginning of the next\r\n    // paragraph while selecting the whole current paragraph.\r\n  selectCurrentParagraph () {\r\n    return this.expandSelectionsForward(selection => selection.selectCurrentParagraph())\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Finaly added selectCurrentParagraph to the selection\r\n\r\n  ``` javascript\r\n      // Public: Selects all the text from the current paragraph\r\n     // which is pointed by the cursor.\r\n  selectCurrentParagraph () {\r\n    let currentParagraphRange = this.cursor.getCurrentParagraphBufferRange()\r\n    if(currentParagraphRange != null) { \r\n      this.setBufferRange(currentParagraphRange);\r\n      this.modifySelection(() => this.cursor.moveToBeginningOfNextParagraph())\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  There was also implemented a test\r\n\r\n  ```javascript\r\n   describe('.selectCurrentParagraph()', () => {\r\n      it('selects from the begginning of the current paragraph to first line of the next paragraph', () => {\r\n        editor.setSelectedBufferRange([[3, 0], [4, 5]])\r\n        editor.addCursorAtScreenPosition([5, 6])\r\n        editor.selectToScreenPosition([6, 2])\r\n\r\n        editor.selectCurrentParagraph()\r\n\r\n        const selections = editor.getSelections()\r\n        expect(selections.length).toBe(1)\r\n        expect(selections[0].getScreenRange()).toEqual([[0, 0], [10, 0]])\r\n      })\r\n    })\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nPeople expect that all selections methods should come in the core package, specially the trivial ones, also, the TextEditor and Selection classes are in core.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nUser can easily select paragraphs.\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n[#14864 Feature request: add select-current-paragraph](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14864) "},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16326","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16326/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16326/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16326/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16326","id":279535748,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzk1MzU3NDg=","number":16326,"title":"Project Find and Replace hangs indefinitely on projects containing symlinks","user":{"login":"Beefster09","id":11081313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDgxMzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11081313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Beefster09","html_url":"https://github.com/Beefster09","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Beefster09/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Beefster09/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Beefster09/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Beefster09/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Beefster09/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Beefster09/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Beefster09/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Beefster09/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Beefster09/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":62363277,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjM2MzI3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-12-05T21:24:03Z","updated_at":"2017-12-06T07:10:46Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

This issue may be related: https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11691\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install [`atom-cursor-indent`](https://atom.io/packages/atom-cursor-indent)\r\n2. Open a text file in Atom\r\n3. Click around, select text with a mouse.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe native selection does not appear, only the Atom selection. The cursor is always visible after clicking into the text editor.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\n\r\nA picture is worth thousand words, please have a look:\r\n![atom-cursor-indent-selection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/498274/33204164-7d814dce-d0b7-11e7-8b01-324ee3379f23.gif)\r\n![atom-cursor-indent-focus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/498274/33204163-7d6b47fe-d0b7-11e7-8b95-3ba6daed3e43.gif)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** \r\n\r\nNot measured scientifically, but I'd say ~50%.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line.

For \r\nexample if the cursor was on the second 'o', the vim-mode-edit would create:\r\n\r\n```\r\nokie == 1){\r\n\t\tdo_awesome_stuff(5);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, when using \"ci)\":\r\n```\r\nif(co\r\n\t\tdo_awesome_stuff(5);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a hard time understanding this as – from my understanding – the desktop\r\nenvironment pushes the layouted keycodes to the userspace-programs, doesn't it? However one could presume that it's the position of the brackets on the german layout which cause this error and explains why the other commands work. As if Atom would grep the keycodes directly and compare them with the english layout.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell at this point the change-inner-commands are  the only vi-commands Atom doesn't execute correctly.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. [Use the German (Neo2) Layout]\r\n2. [Try to use the vi-command to change the content between two brackets]\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [Delete the content between the brackets and let me type new content]\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [Delete everything left from the cursor when using ci(, everything right from the cursor when using ci), delete the whole line when using ci[, same with ci{ and let me type new content]\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [100% of the time]\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom        : 1.22.0\r\nElectron   : 1.6.15\r\nChrome    : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode        : 7.4.0\r\n\r\nDebian 9 \"Stretch\", Kernel 4.9, Gnome-Desktop\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAny additional information, configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16240","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16240/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16240/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16240/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16240","id":275261481,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzUyNjE0ODE=","number":16240,"title":"Check for atom update behind proxy","user":{"login":"hendrikbl","id":9558391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NTgzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/9558391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikbl","html_url":"https://github.com/hendrikbl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikbl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikbl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikbl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikbl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikbl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikbl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikbl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikbl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hendrikbl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-11-20T07:35:10Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T15:41:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

But when I check for updates in the About tab, the message says `No update available. Version 1.20.1 is the latest version.`. This is clearly wrong. It seems Atom itself isn't using the proxy setting and thus can't reach the update server. If this is the case, it should say something like `Couldn't check for updates.` instead.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use corporate proxy\r\n2. Open Atom\r\n3. Configure proxy in `.apmrc`\r\n4. Verify apm is working through the proxy\r\n5. Search for Atom update\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should use apm's proxy to search for updates. If a new version is available, it should say so. If it can't reach the update server, it should say so (e.g. `Couldn't check for updates. Check your internet connection.`.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom doesn't use apm's proxy and can't reach the update server. Even though it wasn't able to check for a new version, the message says `No update available`.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nWindows 7 Enterprise 64-Bit\r\n\r\n`atom --version`\r\nAtom      : 1.20.1\r\nElectron  : 1.6.9\r\nChrome   : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode       : 7.4.0\r\n\r\n`apm --version`\r\napm  1.18.4\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython\r\ngit 2.14.2.windows.3\r\nvisual studio\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16233","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16233/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16233/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16233/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16233","id":275095976,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTUzNDU5ODAw","number":16233,"title":"Fix #16218","user":{"login":"monster860","id":3681297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODEyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3681297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monster860","html_url":"https://github.com/monster860","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monster860/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monster860/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monster860/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monster860/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monster860/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monster860/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monster860/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monster860/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monster860/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-11-18T17:40:13Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T16:47:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/16233","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16233","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16233.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/16233.patch"},"body":"### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required.

Compare the transparent scrollbar to the white scrollbar of project sidebar, because they didn't get customised by Atom Material. \r\n\r\nIn the original 1.20 or later, with Atom Material activated, scrollbar were beautiful, blue and non-transparent, similar to blue bottom border of tabs. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nFulfil and touch the right of the text editor\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nThe white right border appears.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\nMilliseconds \r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom 1.23 Beta\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.13.2\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nHere are three screenshots:\r\n\r\nOpen the first image with black background and notice the white border at right:\r\n\r\n![White border](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2257024/32592024-0df173b2-c509-11e7-8f2a-514ccb21bec8.png)\r\n\r\nWith Atom Material and An Old Hope:\r\n\r\n![With Atom Material and An Old Hope](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2257024/32591909-8cacb316-c508-11e7-819e-0067a2523d18.png)\r\n\r\nWith Atom Material and Legacy TRON:\r\n\r\n![With Atom Material and Legacy TRON](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2257024/32591979-d3197be0-c508-11e7-9731-f66217febaac.png)\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16139","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16139/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16139/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16139/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16139","id":272364685,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzIzNjQ2ODU=","number":16139,"title":"Error searching packages when not running as administrator on Windows 10","user":{"login":"jjhegedus","id":5248699,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDg2OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5248699?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjhegedus","html_url":"https://github.com/jjhegedus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjhegedus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjhegedus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjhegedus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjhegedus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjhegedus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjhegedus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjhegedus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjhegedus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjhegedus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-11-08T21:58:42Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T15:39:21Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen running Atom on Windows 10 as Administrator and searching for packages in the Setting->Install->Install Packages pane, the following error occurs: 'Searching for \"<package name>\" failed.

One `Atom Helper` is using 70-90% CPU, and will stay this way (observed for minutes to hours).\r\n* Removing the project folder does not end the process.\r\n* Closing the window does end the process.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n\r\n100% Can reproduce consistently.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.22.0\r\nElectron: 1.6.15\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\n$ apm --version\r\napm  1.18.8\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.10\r\ngit 2.15.0\r\n\r\n$ sw_vers\r\nProductName:\tMac OS X\r\nProductVersion:\t10.12.6\r\nBuildVersion:\t16G1036\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nOpening the problematic React Native app as a project folder is normal:\r\n\r\n1.

One of the suggestions that came out of it was to have persistent, predictably-behaved controls for docks. This is our proposal for adding them to Atom 😊.\r\n\r\n# In a Nutshell\r\n\r\n![The vertical controls](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126263/32459585-09be428c-c2e5-11e7-93f3-d07597315598.png)\r\n\r\n* Add a vertical icon bar to the left and right docks, indicating their current items and grouping and allowing the docks to be toggled and items to be repositioned.\r\n* Subsume the status-bar package, adding similar controls for the bottom dock.\r\n\r\n# Proposed Changes\r\n\r\n## Control UI\r\n\r\n![dock 20behavior 3a 20default 2c 20groups 2c 20new\r\n<img width=\"445\" alt=\"container group item 1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126263/32459791-9d6b4e6c-c2e5-11e7-9568-5f2310760c1d.png\">\r\n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126263/32459603-1594f5ba-c2e5-11e7-895f-cad922ca11ef.png)\r\n\r\nThe controls behave as follows:\r\n\r\n* Clicking on a group will open the dock, revealing the items in the group or (if the dock is already open and showing that group), close it.\r\n* Dragging an individual icon allows you to move it either within the group, to an existing group, or to create a new group.\r\n* Dragging a group from the grabber (which appears on hover) allows you to move that group.\r\n* The ability to remove items is de-emphasized (as compared to the current tabs behavior); it's only possible via the context menu. (As a result, I think we can remove the `isPermanentDockItem()` optional item method.)\r\n* The icon bars aren't visible unless there are items in the dock.\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n\r\n* Having left and right dock icon bars in the vanilla Atom install (tree-view and GitHub packages respectively) might be a little much. We recommend moving Git/Hub to the left dock by default. Then it'll just have one (with three items).\r\n\r\n## Horizontal Control UI\r\n\r\n![bottomdock 3a 20exposed 20bottom 20panels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126263/32459629-281e0f14-c2e5-11e7-9c50-458d14b2bab0.png)\r\n\r\n![bottomdock_ status bar overflow\r\n<img width=\"445\" alt=\"container group item 1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126263/32459782-977f5552-c2e5-11e7-941e-b85cbb404940.png\">\r\n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126263/32459658-3cdfecce-c2e5-11e7-939e-419101848d59.png)\r\n\r\nControls for the bottom dock will be integrated into the status bar.\r\n\r\n* Grouping (shown in the first pic above) works the same as in the vertical case.\r\n* The areas on the left and right will remain reserved for status bar tiles. If they don't fit in the allotted area, they'll be clipped by the dock icon bar. Mousing over the areas will cause them to expand, covering the dock icon bar until the mouse is moved away. (We'll experiment with the exact affordance.)\r\n* The dock icon bar will have a minimal state containing only the icons (removing the text) if there are too many items for the allotted space.\r\n* When the left dock is open, the width of the left status bar will be tied to that dock's width (though not allowed to go below a minimum). This will keep the bottom icon bar beneath the bottom dock.\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n\r\n* Currently, tabs above the dock items display the icon and title. With the new controls, this is kind of redundant so we've removed them to save on vertical space. We may need to put it in front of people and gauge reactions though.\r\n\r\n## “Tabs of Panes” \r\n\r\nCurrently, docks have the same organization as the workspace center: **containers** (“PaneContainers”) have one or more **groups** (“Panes”), which can each contain multiple **items**, and each group corresponds to a tab bar for selecting the active item (“tabs within panes”) in that group. A single top-level control, however, implies that the user is activating *groups of items*, not individual items (“panes within tabs”)*. \r\n\r\nIn terms of relationships, these two aren't actually that different:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"445\" alt=\"Relationship of concepts: Container, Groups, Items\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126263/32459794-a0f74e0a-c2e5-11e7-86b4-b37760fcc077.png\">\r\n\r\nThe difference, then, is that, **instead of showing one item of every group, Atom will show every item of a single group group**. For example, if the user were to select the ` ⃟ ♡ ♤` group above, the dock would show the three corresponding items, vertically stacked in that order.\r\n\r\nBecause the difference is purely presentational, it should be possible to retain the current PaneContainer and Pane model classes  but associate them with different views in this context. Some new API (e.g. for toggling a Pane) will be necessary.\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n\r\n* How do we handle the need for new API in dock panes? Are dock Panes a subclass of Pane?\r\n* Is the word “pane” so strongly associated with a particular presentation that the difference is confusing?\r\n* What issues will the changes in presentation cause in existing packages? (e.g. currently, non-active items are implicitly non-visible)\r\n* I *think* I can implement this in a separate (but bundled) package, dumb down vanilla docks, and remove the docks interaction from the tabs package.\r\n\r\n## Removal of Dock Toggle Button Affordance\r\n\r\nBecause the docks will be toggled by the icon bars, these are no longer necessary.\r\n\r\n## Badge/Notification Support\r\n\r\nThe presence of persistent controls for dock items means that we'll now have a more natural place for showing those items' statuses than the disconnected icons of the status bar. For example, the button for toggling the diagnostics table can also indicate how many errors there are; the console can indicate new messages.\r\n\r\nOur proposal for this is to add two new (optional) methods on workspace items:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ngetStatus(): {\r\n  severity?: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error',\r\n  count?: number,\r\n},\r\nonDidChangeStatus: (\r\n  cb: (status: {\r\n    severity?: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error',\r\n    count?: number,\r\n  }) => mixed,\r\n) => IDisposable,\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile somewhat limiting, this API enforces a consistency of experience across dock items and can be easily expanded later.\r\n\r\nAtom will subscribe to this event and show appropriate badges on the items in the persistent controls.\r\n\r\nOpen questions:\r\n\r\n* I chose `getStatus()` and `onDidChangeStatus()` for symmetry with `getTitle()`, `onDidChangeTitle()`, `getIcon()`, etc. However, in many ways, `observeStatus()` is more natural. Unlike title and icon, status is a changing value by definition. Also, having users implement one method instead of two would be nice. I still think having two methods is the right call but I wanted to flag this for discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n*See #672 for some history on this terminology.\r\n\r\ncc @karincurkowicz who's been doing the design work on this and @nathansobo who we talked to a while back"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16106","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16106/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16106/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16106/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16106","id":271315409,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzEzMTU0MDk=","number":16106,"title":"Workspace Item API documentation is truncated","user":{"login":"WolfieMario","id":2306560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2306560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolfieMario","html_url":"https://github.com/WolfieMario","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolfieMario/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolfieMario/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolfieMario/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolfieMario/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolfieMario/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolfieMario/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolfieMario/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolfieMario/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WolfieMario/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":104428530,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDQ0Mjg1MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-11-05T21:22:47Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T05:40:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"The [Workspace](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.21.2/Workspace) documentation has a section on \"Workspace Items\", which is truncated to just the following:\r\n\r\n> ## Workspace Items\r\n> \r\n> The term \"item\" refers to anything that can be displayed in a pane within the workspace, either in the [WorkspaceCenter](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.21.2/WorkspaceCenter) or in one of the three [Dock](https://atom.io/docs/api/v1.21.2/Dock)s.

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis PR unconditionally activates packages when a deserializer for that package is called.  It also adds a new way of deferring package activation through the `workspaceOpeners` key.  Supply it an array of workspace opener filepaths/URIs that your package watches for and it will remain deactivated until one of those openers is called.  This is useful when used in conjunction with deserializers, which often are created using workspace openers.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate how a package would benefit from this PR, consider a package that listens to the opener `atom://example` to create a new `ExampleView` that has a serializer.  `atom://example` is listed as a workspace opener in `package.json`.  The `example:open-example-view` command calls `atom.workspace.open('atom://example')` and is listed as an activation command in `package.json`.  This package structure is in use by packages such as Timecop and Markdown Preview.\r\nPreviously, there was no way to safely defer activation for a package that implemented serialization because it would not be activated when deserialization occurred.\r\n* Defining the activation command would break deserialization, as the view would get added but the package was technically not activated and as such had no registered styles, commands, menus, etc.\r\n  * With this PR, the deserializer forces the package to be activated.\r\n* Opening the view, closing it, reloading Atom, then reopening the view through methods such as `pane:reopen-closed-item` would throw an `EINVAL: open atom:\\example` error on Windows due to the workspace opener not being registered.\r\n  * With this PR, `workspaceOpeners` registers a dummy opener for the opener that then activates the package and calls the real opener.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThere could be another key added to deserializers stating whether or not that deserializer should activate the package.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nDeserializing happens in core.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nDeserializing, openers, and deferred activation techniques can be used together.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nPerhaps there are some deserializers that don't need the package to be activated?  In which case this will slow down Atom's load time unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nCloses #16099"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16099","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16099/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16099/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16099/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16099","id":271206276,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzEyMDYyNzY=","number":16099,"title":"Deserializing a package should activate it","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjYwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":118249520,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTgyNDk1MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/api","name":"api","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":274751644,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3NTE2NDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/proposal","name":"proposal","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-11-04T16:51:22Z","updated_at":"2018-11-04T19:37:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI feel like deserializing a package should activate it as well.  For example, I'm experimenting with delaying Timecop activation until the `timecop:show` command is called.  However, I also serialize TimecopView so that if it is open when Atom closes it remains open when Atom restarts.  The problem occurs when TimecopView is deserialized and re-added to the workspace, but Timecop itself is not activated (leading to an odd half-activated state where Timecop is running but has no styling).  This could be avoided by (optionally?) activating the package when the deserializer function is called."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16078","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16078/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16078/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/16078/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16078","id":270750819,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzA3NTA4MTk=","number":16078,"title":"Code folding artifacts in some cases (repeated fold line)","user":{"login":"BountifulClutter","id":32170700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTcwNzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/32170700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BountifulClutter","html_url":"https://github.com/BountifulClutter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BountifulClutter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BountifulClutter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BountifulClutter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BountifulClutter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BountifulClutter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BountifulClutter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BountifulClutter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BountifulClutter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BountifulClutter/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1109084087,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDg0MDg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/d%20%E2%AC%86%EF%B8%8F","name":"d ⬆️","color":"d1d1d1","default":false},{"id":84710475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NDcxMDQ3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":1109084562,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDg0NTYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/i%20%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F","name":"i ⬇️","color":"ededed","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false},{"id":1109083354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDgzMzU0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/v%20%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F","name":"v ⬇️","color":"ededed","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":23,"created_at":"2017-11-02T18:00:52Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T17:59:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"*Edit by @rsese to clean up issue body and add latest details*\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * [Reproduced after resetting to factory defaults but in safe mode since repro steps require a community package] Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of reports of duplicated code fold lines since around Atom 1.21.2 but with some trouble coming up with specific steps to reproduce (e.g. no specific common community packages though a couple of folks mentioned it happened commonly for them in large files).\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/16078#issuecomment-421336384 we did get specific reproduction steps though.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nvia https://github.com/elpollodiablo84/language-matlab-plus/issues/1#issue-332767387 h/t @elpollodiablo84 (I couldn't reproduce with other packages installed so ended up temporarily resetting to [factory defaults](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#reset-to-factory-defaults) first):\r\n\r\n1. `apm install language-matlab-plus`\r\n2.

No tests for new functionality or fixed bugs yet.\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis mostly fixes bugs or logic errors, but also introduces a way to score a grammar based on how well did the first line pattern match a given document.\r\n\r\nHighlights for the impatient:\r\n* Removed underscore requirement from the file 🎉 \r\n* Minimum score a grammar can now obtain is 0, meaning it did not match at all.\r\n* Instead of using the somewhat clever way of storing the score information in integer part and fractional part of the score, all info is now all packed to inside a 53 bit integer `[0, Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER]` due to the requirement to predictably store two varying-length scoring criteria compared to just one.\r\n![bit_layout_for_grammar_scoring](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1017132/31943457-86a7f838-b8d1-11e7-98f8-1ec9feda6977.png)\r\nIf either criteria exceeds their given bit range, they'll gain the largest possible value (all 1-s in its range).\r\n* Fixed a bug caused in #13597 where non-bundled package criteria was considered only if path matched. The non-bundled package criteria should have been also applied if only first line does match.\r\n* Fixed path scoring ignoring the contents of the delimiters when matching. This allowed the `fileType` `a/b/c` to be matched in a path such as `/some/path/some-filename.a.b.c`\r\n* Changed path scoring to take into account the preceding period in path if the pattern did not start with either a period or slash in order to give an advantage to (most, if not all) file types that don't specify a period in front of them. If the intention is to match just dotfiles or filenames, this can now be done accurately by specifying `/.dotfile` or `/somefile` as file type. This was inspired by the [TextMate implementation](https://github.com/textmate/textmate/blob/0a597f15050ab35fa12d31076e95e7692558b05d/Frameworks/io/src/path.cc#L204-L218).\r\n* Allow explicitly to match file types which specify a suffix using underscore. This is useful for Cucumber/Gherkin steps files, which end with `_steps.rb`.\r\n* Fixed an edge case in path matching where for each user defined file type that matched, the score was incremented even if the match was not the longest. \r\n* Removed `grammarMatchesContents` in favor of newly created `getContentScore`. It felt safe to do so, because it's considered a private method and I couldn't find any other uses on Github. Essentially the same thing, but instead of returning true/false it returns a length count of the matched text. Zero-length match is distinguished from no match.\r\n* Removed newline count \"optimization\" from the first line matching due to it counting across the whole pattern for just newlines, which gives the worst case maximum possible literal newlines that needs to match (overshooting in cases such as `a\\n|b\\nc`), but does not consider other characters that might contain newline (`\\s`; `.` metacharacter if `s` modifier was set, if `\\n` count is increased using a modifier `\\n+` or `(\\n)*`, etc...). It's an artifact from TextMate. We'll assume the input given is already limited by the caller in order to allow more flexible matching:\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/blob/0511c0ae4a5f18b81b3c64ad31f15dbfd8ba3a38/src/text-editor-registry.js#L30\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nA version where the score was more detailed object with separate criteria was briefly considered. For compatibility reasons and simply due to not making much sense, the packing into single integer was preferred instead.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nIt mostly already is.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nMore granular grammar evaluation, less likely users are greeted by an incorrectly highlighted file. Grammar developers can leverage extra flexibility.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nCode is slightly harder to grok because bitwise operations are done using regular multiplication and addition (JavaScript's bitwise operations are limited to 32 bits, however `Number` integer range is 53 bits). I've done my best to make it as easy to understand as possible.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/language-php/pull/292\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/first-mate/issues/17"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15959","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15959/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15959/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15959/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15959","id":267397449,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTQ3OTUzMTc4","number":15959,"title":"Only use decreaseIndentRegex when decreaseNextIndentRegex did not fire","user":{"login":"kbrose","id":4053170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTMxNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4053170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose","html_url":"https://github.com/kbrose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kbrose/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2017-10-21T17:10:19Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T16:47:40Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15959","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15959","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15959.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15959.patch"},"body":"### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nWhen auto-indenting, only check if the current line matches `decreaseIndentRegex` if the previous line did not already match `decreaseNextIndentRegex`.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nAdd a new indentation regex `decreaseNextIndentOnlyOncePattern` (or something more pithy) that would behave the same as `decreaseNextIndentPattern` but would block triggering of `decreaseIndentPattern` on the next line.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nThis is a modification to functionality that already exists in core.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nBetter auto-indentation for at least the python language.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\n***EDIT:*** I have just tested language-go (the only `language-*` built in package that uses `decreaseNextIndentRegex`, and unfortunately this change would break their current usage in the following case:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n    switch i {\r\n    case 1:\r\n        fmt.Println(\r\n            \"one\") // relies on triggering decreaseNextIndentRegex\r\n    case 2: // relies on again triggering decreaseIndentRegex\r\n```\r\n\r\n:(\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15926\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/language-python/issues/213\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\nI'm sure I'll be asked to write tests, but I'm not sure of a good way to go about that when none of the built-in language-* repos currently use `decreaseNextIndentRegex`.

This was a build on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, with locally built pythons - 3.6 and 3.7a in /usr/local/bin\r\n2. attempt build per instructions, including `npm config set python /usr/local/bin/python2 -g`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nSuccessful build;\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nError in python-intercept.sh (complaint about python version 3.6.3).\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\nAlways.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nmaster / HEAD\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15912","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15912/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15912/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15912/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15912","id":266066729,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNjYwNjY3Mjk=","number":15912,"title":"spellchecker thread crashes atom (loosing unsaved input)","user":{"login":"despairblue","id":927609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNzYwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/927609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue","html_url":"https://github.com/despairblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/despairblue/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":153145129,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTMxNDUxMjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/crash","name":"crash","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":28,"created_at":"2017-10-17T10:08:01Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T23:33:41Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe spellchecker thread crashes atom on mac os fairly regularly.

into invisible single pixel strips. While it's possible to resize the window to a \"normal\" size, maximizing the window causes it to collapse again. \r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Snap the atom window to the sides and top until problem occurs.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The window should be hidden completely, maximized, or snapped to a side of the screen. Maximizing the window should cause the window to fill the available screen.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nThe window collapses into what seems to be the smallest possible dimension. Maximizing the window after resizing causes the window to collapse again.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.21.0\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\napm  1.18.5\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.11.0\r\n\r\nDistributor ID:\tUbuntu\r\nDescription:\tUbuntu 17.04\r\nRelease:\t17.04\r\nCodename:\tzesty\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line.

The location of the core library definitions was moved from bin/ to lib/ somewhere between TypeScript 1.4 and 1.5, which means that typescript-simple is unable to find the core library defs (lib.d.ts) when installed with the most recent version of TypeScript matching ~1.4.1. In other words, Atom's built-in TypeScript support is essentially broken, and when it sees lib/line-diff-details.ts, it tries to transpile it, but the definitions it needs aren't where it expects them, and boom, error.\r\n\r\nThis issue is breaking plugins that depend on TypeScript transpilation, such as [line-diff-details](https://atom.io/packages/line-diff-details). According to the same user, the fix [should be simple](https://github.com/jakesankey/line-diff-details/issues/45#issuecomment-337011435):\r\n\r\n> I think it should just require bumping Atom's dependency on typescript-simple from 1.0.0 (which is now broken) to any version that uses TypeScript 1.5 or later. It should probably not be 2.x, though, since that has the potential to leave some packages already using TS just as broken as they were before.\r\n\r\nThe exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAt ENOENT, node_modules/typescript/bin/lib.d.ts not found in /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar\r\n\r\nError: ENOENT, node_modules/typescript/bin/lib.d.ts not found in /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar\r\n    at notFoundError (ELECTRON_ASAR.js:115:19)\r\n    at Object.fs.readFileSync (ELECTRON_ASAR.js:514:9)\r\n    at TypeScriptSimple.createService (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/typescript-simple/index.js:71:73)\r\n    at TypeScriptSimple.compile (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/node_modules/typescript-simple/index.js:60:43)\r\n    at Object.exports.compile (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/typescript.js:54:53)\r\n    at Object.compile (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package-transpilation-registry.js:79:33)\r\n    at compileFileAtPath (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/compile-cache.js:97:37)\r\n    at Object.value [as .ts] (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/compile-cache.js:238:26)\r\n    at Module.load (module.js:488:32)\r\n    at tryModuleLoad (module.js:447:12)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:439:3)\r\n    at Module.require (/app.asar/static/index.js:47:45)\r\n    at require (internal/module.js:20:19)\r\n    at customRequire (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/static/<embedded>:96:26)\r\n    at Package.module.exports.Package.requireMainModule (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:903:35)\r\n    at /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:158:34\r\n    at Package.module.exports.Package.measure (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:99:21)\r\n    at Package.module.exports.Package.load (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:144:18)\r\n    at PackageManager.loadAvailablePackage (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package-manager.js:617:16)\r\n    at config.transact (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package-manager.js:530:20)\r\n    at Config.module.exports.Config.transact (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/config.js:342:22)\r\n    at PackageManager.loadPackages (/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package-manager.js:528:23)\r\n    at /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/atom-environment.js:821:34\r\n```"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15881","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15881/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15881/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15881/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15881","id":265153688,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNjUxNTM2ODg=","number":15881,"title":"running Atom on `arm64`","user":{"login":"othiym23","id":418097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODA5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/418097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/othiym23","html_url":"https://github.com/othiym23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othiym23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othiym23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othiym23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othiym23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othiym23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othiym23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othiym23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othiym23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/othiym23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-10-13T02:50:52Z","updated_at":"2018-05-29T14:02:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"/cc @vanessayuenn, @kuychaco, @groundwater, @zcbenz\r\n\r\nHere are the takeaways from a hack week that I and the above-linked folks did recently to get Atom up and running on an [`arm64` laptop](https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=3707). Towards the end there's a checklist of tasks that would need to be done to take our hacked-up build and turn it into a first-class member of the Electron / Atom commons.\r\n\r\n### building Atom on and for `arm64`\r\n\r\nThe current Electron build infrastructure is designed to make it quick for end-user developers to assemble apps. Many pieces that are built at the same time (mostly as part of [`electron/libchromiumcontent`](https://github.com/electron/libchromiumcontent)) are packaged separately and then pulled together using package scripts that run downloaders at npm / yarn install time, because some or all of them may be unnecessary for some applications. This makes bootstrapping new architectures tricky, because it's difficult to build and incorporate those components incrementally, without bootstrapping the entire infrastructure.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Google _really_ wants anything ARM-related to be cross-compiled instead of built on ARM devices directly. (A pity, because @groundwater found a [really awesome and cheap](https://packet.net) service that rents out 96-core `arm64` servers.) With the exception of `armv7l` builds, which are special in other ways, cross-compilation isn't done for official Electron builds.\r\n\r\nFor example, `mksnapshot` is necessary to build the snapshot that is, by default, _required_ for the core Atom UI modules to be loaded into the editor (to get Atom running on `arm64`, because we couldn't get snapshotting working with our ARM frankenbuild, @zcbenz had to produce a one-off version of the Atom [ASAR](https://github.com/electron/asar) that includes the JavaScript that normally would have been compiled into the snapshot), and because it generates partially-compiled code meant to be consumed directly by a specific version of V8, is difficult to build without knowing the settings after the fact.\r\n\r\nWe used `gn` to build `arm64`-native and cross-targeted `linux-x64` builds of `mksnapshot` (that could be built using `ninja` instead of dealing with `gyp`). Neither produced a blob for V8 that worked, even though I'm pretty sure we had matching versions of V8. Using a `mksnapshot` built from the same tree as the rest of `libchromiumcontent` and `v8` would probably solve this\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n### packages built from Google's tree(s) in the frankenbuild\r\n\r\n1. `electron` was built locally (from a `1.6.x` tree) instead of being pulled from the GH releases page, and required patches to be made to the installed copies of `electron-packager` and `electron-download`.\r\n1. `dump_syms`, which is used by `minidump`, and is a part of `breakpad`, depends on a set of macros that need to have support for whatever ARM64 compiler pragma indicates the platform added to the include files.\r\n1. `mksnapshot` is hosted on `atom/atom`; isn't built for `arm64`.\r\n1. `chromedriver` is hosted on `atom/atom`; isn't built for `arm64`.\r\n\r\n### hacks done to work around the preceding\r\n\r\n1. A newer version of `electron-packager` that knows about `arm64` is required; update `package.json` to `electron-packager@9.1.0`.\r\n1. `chromedriver` is only used for tests, and isn't available from the `electron/electron` Releases page for `arm64` (yet). Remove it from `package.json`.\r\n1. Until the `dump_syms` issue is resolved, all of the crash reporter infrastrucure needs to be disabled (and `minidump` needs to be removed from `package.json`).\r\n1. `mksnapshot` needs to be commented out; it's possible to build a natively-hosted version for arm that can be used in the build process, but until we can figure out how to get it to work, it just slows down the build without doing anything useful. `electron-mksnapshot` also needs to be removed from `package.json`.\r\n1. The Atom ASAR needs to be built by hand to include the assets that would otherwise be compiled into the snapshot. Without this, Atom is a sad panda. All credit to @zcbenz for figuring this out.\r\n\r\n## steps necessary to make `arm64` a first-class Electron citizen\r\n\r\n- [ ] Modify Electron's build system to support cross-compilation. I'd be interested to hear from anyone at Google about how many of their own Chromium builds are cross-compiled; I suspect it's a far higher percentage than are currently done for either Electron or Atom.\r\n- [ ] Alternatively, figure out why `mksnapshot` is specifically configured to not be compiled for native builds of chromium / libchromiumcontent in the GN configuration.\r\n- [ ] Produce `arm64` release builds of `electron`, `breakpad`, and `electron-mksnapshot`. This is more than just modifying the build infrastructure; some of the native code needs to be modified to know about `arm64` and `arm64-linux` pragmas in things like header files. The changes are pretty simple and mostly just involve cut and paste, but they're scattered all over the place, so some care is required.\r\n\r\n## steps necessary to make `arm64` a first-class platform for Atom\r\n- One of:\r\n  - [ ] Get `mksnapshot` working on `arm64`, either natively or via cross-compilation (cross-compilation is preferred, because then CI could produce the snapshot without requiring an ARM build machine).\r\n  - [ ] Replace the Atom bootstrap that uses the snapshot with putting those same files in the ASAR, either specifically for `arm64` or in general. CPU cycles aren't cheap on the pine64 machines, but once Atom's up and running, its performance is at least acceptable, so this may be a worthwhile workaround until snapshotting can be made to work.\r\n\r\nSome or all of the above could be turned into freestanding issues, once the determination is made to move forward with `arm64` / supporting the pinebook.\r\n\r\nAlso, if left to my own devices, I'd probably make some changes to Atom's build system to rely less on a monolithic builder script and more on a more cleanly-factored set of package scripts called from `package.json`, but that ventures onto the shaky ground of yak shaving and is best discussed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHack week friends, what am I forgetting?"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15871","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15871/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15871/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15871/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15871","id":264754740,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTQ2MDc2MTE2","number":15871,"title":"forceHideTitleBar","user":{"login":"sean-codes","id":21677355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3MzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/21677355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sean-codes","html_url":"https://github.com/sean-codes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sean-codes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sean-codes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sean-codes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sean-codes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sean-codes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sean-codes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sean-codes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sean-codes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sean-codes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-10-11T22:21:01Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T16:30:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15871","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15871","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15871.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15871.patch"},"body":"\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required.

I set up [an isolated test case](https://rawgit.com/Alhadis/0af615e679f4fa1d0c2b5ae3113ee0a3/raw/6474909eb9c8bf7ed6ff3b0e04bb63f4a23058a7/index.html) as a Gist. The SVG source of these two circle icons can be found alongside the demo fixture:\r\n1. [3-point ring shape](https://gist.github.com/Alhadis/0af615e679f4fa1d0c2b5ae3113ee0a3#file-annulus-3pt-svg)\r\n2.

It's really strange, because I don't know if this is Electron-specific, an issue with Chromium itself, or an actual fault with the text-rendering software that's now used by High Sierra.\r\n\r\nI strongly believe it was related to the OS update, as I distinctly recalled the icons getting clipped right after it finished installing and Atom reloaded.\r\n\r\nConfirmed to be affecting Chrome v61.0.3163.100 and the current stable/beta versions of Atom. These glyphs are rendering fine on both Firefox 56.0 64-bit and Safari v11.0 (13604.1.38.1.6), though.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Resizing the pane a couple of times sometimes fixes this. It happens in both the editor as well as the gutter. I use a converted pixel font (Terminus TTF), so the cut-off pixel is clearly visible. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set editor font to Terminus TTF.\r\n2. Type some text in the editor.\r\n3.

This is because Atom seems to keep the viewport at a fixed position from the top of the file during a resize, causing the file content to be pushed down (by the addition of new soft wrap lines) and your current position in the file being lost.\r\n\r\nWhy is this feature important? Here are two common use cases where this issue occurs:\r\n\r\n- Opening/closing a vertical split\r\n- Toggling the tree view\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Enable soft wrapping (`preferences -> editor -> soft wrap`)\r\n2. Open a long file and navigate to a position a decent way down the file (in my example below the file is 1000 lines long and I have the cursor on line 878)\r\n3. Resize the window and observe your current position in the file being pushed down below the viewport\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nWhen a tab is resized, your current position in the file should stay visible within the viewport instead of being push down below the viewport due to the addition of soft tab lines.\r\n\r\nThis expected behaviour is the default behaviour in both VS Code and in Vim (maybe in other editors as well, they are the only two I tested).\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the expected behaviour, in VS Code:\r\n\r\n![gif_vscode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3773641/31256183-a5f9b176-aa7c-11e7-9b96-7793a05ac7e9.gif)\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nWhen a tab is resized, the current position in the file is pushed down below the viewport by the extra soft wrapped lines being added to the file. This results in you losing your place in a file everytime you open a vertical split, toggle the tree view, etc.  Here is an example of this, using the same file and line number from the VS Code example above:\r\n\r\n![gif_atom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3773641/31256196-b3106ecc-aa7c-11e7-8eea-0cac38d5b8b0.gif)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\n100% of the time this is reproducable\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\napm: 1.18.5\r\n Atom: 1.21.0 \r\nOS: MacOS Sierra 10.12.3 \r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15824","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15824/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15824/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15824/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15824","id":263177972,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNjMxNzc5NzI=","number":15824,"title":"Atom ui elements all zoomed","user":{"login":"vigenere23","id":32545895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTQ1ODk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/32545895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigenere23","html_url":"https://github.com/vigenere23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigenere23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigenere23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigenere23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigenere23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigenere23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigenere23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigenere23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigenere23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vigenere23/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2017-10-05T15:55:33Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T15:31:19Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

By filing an Issue, you are expected to comply with it, including treating everyone with respect: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\r\n\r\nDo you want to ask a question?

Have a UTF-8 file with unicode U+0091 in it.\r\n2. Open file in Atom to have it displayed as �\r\n3. Make change somewhere in file other than the hex 91 character and save file\r\n4. Open in notepad++ to see the character is now different as the hex in the file for U+0091 has been rewritten as � (0xEFBFBD) from the 0x91 it was previously.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** When you open a file with Unicode characters, U+0091 in particular, it renders as the � character. If you change ANYTHING but that character, and save the file, unaltered character values should not change. When opening in another editor, that supports said Unicode character, it should render it fine. That character value should not be changed on save when the character was never altered during the edit.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** When you open a file with Unicode characters U+0091 in particular, it renders as the � character. If you change ANYTHING but that character, and save the file, the hex value for what should be U+0091 is changed to 0xEFBFBD.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom

Turns out that Chromium/macOS switches between a light and dark handle based on the `background-color` of the element that has `overflow` scrolling enabled. Unfortunately we can't just add a background color to the scrollbars of `atom-text-editor` because it would cover the code underneath.\r\n\r\nAs a potential solution, this PR adds the syntax background color to scrollbars initially only for a very short time through a keyframe animation and then removes the background color again. This will have the effect that the scrollbars still pick up the right syntax background color and adjust the handle accordingly for dark themes.\r\n\r\nBefore | After\r\n--- | ---\r\n![screen shot 2017-09-09 at 12 47 01 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/30237351-0f84751c-956b-11e7-9e26-2c80e072a3be.png) | ![screen shot 2017-09-09 at 12 46 02 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/30237353-1158c226-956b-11e7-8445-4a63ac286798.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nInstead of an animation (adding and removing the background color) we could also keep an almost transparent background color, like `background-color: fade(@syntax-background-color, 0.01%);`. It won't be visible by eye. But using an animation feels still slightly better since it's more temporarily. \r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be to implement our own custom scrollbars, but that's much bigger in scope.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nSince all dark themes are affected.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nBetter buffer scrollbar handle contrast for dark themes.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nA keyframe animation might have negative side effects on the buffer, like causing repaint or so. /cc @nathansobo @as-cii \r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nFixes #15401"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15586","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15586/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15586/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15586/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15586","id":256029336,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNTYwMjkzMzY=","number":15586,"title":"Revert buffer / Revert to saved / Refresh from source","user":{"login":"skylize","id":844400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NDQwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/844400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylize","html_url":"https://github.com/skylize","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylize/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylize/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylize/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylize/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylize/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylize/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylize/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylize/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skylize/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODU2NDQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-09-07T18:28:40Z","updated_at":"2018-04-03T16:07:36Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

This package has zero documentation and appears to not be maintained. \r\n\r\nThe functionality provided by this tiny package is just a single command to reset the buffered text to the content saved on disk. I am quite surprised this functionality is not already in core. We shouldn't need to install a package to do this. \r\n\r\nAtom should move this to core and make it available to various menus and deal with any open issues brought up on that package's repo.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\nOpening `File` menu or context clicking on a file in `Tree View` or typing `\"revert` into `Command Palette` displays an option to revert file to it's saved state. `File` menu and `Command Palette` also displays the wisely selected default hotkey for this command.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\nIn order to revert file to saved, I must close and reopen the file or install the undocumented and poorly interfaced `revert-buffer` package.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nWindows:    10\r\nAtom    : 1.19.6\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\napm  1.18.4\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython\r\ngit 2.12.0.windows.1\r\nvisual studio\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nNone\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15585","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15585/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15585/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15585/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15585","id":256015134,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNTYwMTUxMzQ=","number":15585,"title":"Scrollbar moves to the top when splitting panes","user":{"login":"Ben3eeE","id":1058982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTg5ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1058982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE","html_url":"https://github.com/Ben3eeE","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ben3eeE/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-09-07T17:35:12Z","updated_at":"2017-09-07T17:35:12Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n![scrollbar position](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1058982/30176488-e483daf6-9402-11e7-9fb0-726733af7856.gif)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Have a document open in Atom, notice the position of the scroll bar\r\n2. Alt+Tab to a window over Atom\r\n3. Scroll down a lot\r\n4. Alt+Tab back to Atom\r\n5. Scroll down\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe editor window scrolls down a bit\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\nThe editor windows scrolls by the sum of the scroll amounts in step 3. + 5.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:**\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nOS: Fedora 26\r\n\r\n`atom --version`\r\nAtom    : 1.19.4\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\n`gnome-shell --version`\r\nGNOME Shell 3.24.3\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15431","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15431/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15431/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15431/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15431","id":252491672,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTM3MzcyNDA0","number":15431,"title":"Upgrade to Electron Packager 11","user":{"login":"malept","id":11417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/malept","html_url":"https://github.com/malept","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malept/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malept/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malept/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malept/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malept/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malept/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malept/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malept/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/malept/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722972,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3MjI5NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-testing","name":"needs-testing","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":16,"created_at":"2017-08-24T05:33:25Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T16:47:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15431","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15431","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15431.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15431.patch"},"body":"### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nHi there, I'm the maintainer of Electron Packager.

This only happens for `atom`, as far as I can tell, and for no other programs. Running\r\n\r\n       rm /usr/local/bin/atom\r\n       ln -s /Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/atom.sh /usr/local/bin/atom\r\n\r\nAlways fixes the issue. I am unable to figure out when this happens, or why, as my path or environment does not change in between sessions, at all. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open your terminal.\r\n2. Type `atom`.\r\n3. Sometimes - but not at all times - it may fail appropriately.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** `atom` should always be found in my PATH.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** It isn't.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 5%~\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.19.2\r\nElectron: 1.6.9\r\nChrome  : 56.0.2924.87\r\nNode    : 7.4.0\r\n\r\nOS: OS X 10.12 Sierra\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to diagnose this, at all. Any suggestions for more information would be great. Here are [my dotfiles](https://github.com/RichardLitt/dotfiles).

There is no spec for single-line selected text being indented via `indent()`: https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/a7736b81e3f6628f2a9e685f28f4c1df9a5e4615/spec/text-editor-spec.coffee#L3673-L3789\r\n\r\n2. `indentSelectedRows` (which is used in `indent()`) is poorly documented:\r\nhttps://github.com/atom/atom/blob/a7736b81e3f6628f2a9e685f28f4c1df9a5e4615/src/selection.coffee#L671-L679\r\n    > If the selection spans multiple rows, indent all of them.\r\n\r\n    It's possible to interpret this in a way that if the selection does not span across multiple rows, then nothing gets indented. [_Insert your favorite programmer-goes-to-grocery-store-joke here._](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1nmkfq/a_programmer_is_going_to_the_grocery_store/)\r\n\r\n3. The current behavior is not intuitive and unexpected for anyone coming from a different editor. With the exception of Brackets, other text editors tend to agree that selecting text and pressing tab within a single line should not indent the whole line, but insert/overwrite with a tab.\r\n\r\nOutdent is done through `outdentSelectedRows`, which [has a spec for single line selected text](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/2420d12e44f33f0178c8c0ef41e3a2c22cf4fb8e/spec/text-editor-spec.coffee#L4265-L4270). However it seems to be slightly mislabeled, there is actually less than one line selected. That is not a big deal and can be easily fixed, but it's possible that something is missing from here too.\r\n\r\nAt minimum I am looking to define behavior for following cases:\r\n1. Selecting whole line and issuing `indent()`.\r\n2. Selecting substring within line with length greater than 0 and issuing `indent()`.\r\n3. Selecting whole line and issuing `outdentSelectedRows()`.\r\n4. Selecting substring within line with length greater than 0 and issuing `outdentSelectedRows()`.\r\n\r\nThere might be additional cases that might need be considered, but I don't want this to be come overly ambitious, so starting with a more managable goal might be better.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for all of this comes from behavior related to text selections that come from traversing tab stops within snippets, where indenting/outdenting may lead to unexpected results:\r\n\r\n![indent_snippet1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1017132/28608860-e7ee5908-71ea-11e7-8bc2-19aadfcc2a3b.gif)\r\n![indent_snippet2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1017132/28608859-e7edd960-71ea-11e7-90d3-7b1bfb94e899.gif)\r\n\r\nPersonally I think that outdent behavior can be kept as-is and it is sufficient to simply improve the spec and cover cases 3 and 4. Outdenting does not break out of snippet's tab stops whereas indenting does, so indicating change with a slightly more destructive (but predictable) operation should be obvious enough that it's impossible to return to snippet's tab stops.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio Code's behavior is a suitable candidate, which indents if the whole line is selected, but inserts a tab when only part of line is selected. Outdent is handled in the same way as Atom does it now. If there aren't any objections or better ideas, I might just implement that and propose this as the final solution.\r\n\r\nCode at the time of writing in pull request is just to get the ball rolling and does not represent the final proposed solution in any way. But it does replace everything with a tab if at most only one line has been selected."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15090","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15090/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15090/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15090/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15090","id":245481467,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNDU0ODE0Njc=","number":15090,"title":"Atom doesn't correctly indent lines with combining diacritics","user":{"login":"alexchandel","id":637714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/637714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel","html_url":"https://github.com/alexchandel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":84710475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NDcxMDQ3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-07-25T17:48:59Z","updated_at":"2018-07-26T22:05:44Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n[Description of the issue]\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

But, anyway, Atom already do the same thing by running 'wmic' on Windows :)\r\n<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nIt fixes #7252 : Problem with killing children processes \r\n\r\n<!-- Enter any applicable Issues here -->\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15036","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15036/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15036/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15036/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15036","id":243266292,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTMwNzY2MTU5","number":15036,"title":"Added docstring comments in title-bar.js","user":{"login":"Aaron09","id":13459795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDU5Nzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/13459795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron09","html_url":"https://github.com/Aaron09","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron09/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron09/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron09/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron09/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron09/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron09/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron09/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron09/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aaron09/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-07-16T21:03:31Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T16:47:34Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/15036","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15036","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15036.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/15036.patch"},"body":"### Description of the Change:\r\n-- Added comments in the form of docstrings to title-bar.js for improved readability\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n-- Improved internal documentation in the form of docstrings is the current best practice for code commenting\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n-- It will improve the readability and thus maintainability for the code for the future\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n-- It will aid future developers for Atom by improving the readability of the code for title-bar.js\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n-- None\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n-- It is improving code maintainability"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15032","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15032/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15032/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/15032/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/15032","id":243175996,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNDMxNzU5OTY=","number":15032,"title":"Weird render glitches on Skylake GPU","user":{"login":"awilkins","id":368399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODM5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/368399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awilkins","html_url":"https://github.com/awilkins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awilkins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awilkins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awilkins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awilkins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awilkins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awilkins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awilkins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awilkins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awilkins/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":15,"created_at":"2017-07-15T13:40:49Z","updated_at":"2018-01-15T10:58:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOdd rendering glitches on Skylake GPU / HiDPI screen.\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen when the new rendering pipeline is under stress.

On a Mac with 2 monitors, arrange them so that the secondary monitor is positioned higher and to the left of the primary monitor, like so: <img width=\"668\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-07-13 at 5 39 33 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5263654/28193555-934b56be-67f2-11e7-9255-ae81d1e2ea98.png\">\r\n2. Open Atom and mentally note the window size and position.\r\n3. Open settings to ensure that \"Restore Previous Windows On Start\" is set to \"always\".\r\n4. Move Atom's application window fully onto the secondary monitor, so that the top left corner of it is positioned above the height of the primary window. Optionally, resize the window to be noticeably different than the original size. \r\n5. Open the Developer tools and enter `atom.getPosition()` into the console.\r\n6. Observe that the current widow position x and y values are both negative, like so: \r\n![screen shot 2017-07-13 at 5 56 51 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5263654/28193853-eca1fd56-67f4-11e7-99c3-f00acfeca7d0.png)\r\n7. Quit Atom via CMD+Q or via the File menu.\r\n8. Open Atom.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Atom should restore the window position and size due to the \"Restore Previous Windows On Start\" setting.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The window will open in the position it was in at step 2. \r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100% (if the above steps are followed)\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n**Atom:**\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\n**apm:**\r\napm  1.18.1\r\nnpm  3.10.10\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.10\r\n\r\n**MacOS:**\r\nSystem Version:\tmacOS 10.12.5 (16F73)\r\nMac Model Identifier:\tMacBookPro13,2 \r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThe issue appears to be caused by an assumption that window positions are calculated relative to the monitor they reside on, not relative to the primary monitor position. The validation logic is found in the `isValidDimensions` method of `atom-environment.coffee` at line 635:\r\n```\r\n# Returns true if the dimensions are useable, false if they should be ignored.\r\n# Work around for https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/issues/473\r\n    isValidDimensions: ({x, y, width, height}={}) ->\r\n    width > 0 and height > 0 and x + width > 0 and y + height > 0\r\n```\r\nThe intent seems to be to prevent saving positions that would place the window outside the viewable area of the monitors, but in our case it generates a false negative due to the way the position data is calculated, and therefore the window position is not saved if your setup is as described above. \r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14992","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14992/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14992/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14992/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14992","id":241965880,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNDE5NjU4ODA=","number":14992,"title":"Tree View crashes Atom when opening file on remounted disk volume","user":{"login":"cdon-dev-crew","id":26403650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDAzNjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/26403650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdon-dev-crew","html_url":"https://github.com/cdon-dev-crew","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdon-dev-crew/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdon-dev-crew/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdon-dev-crew/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdon-dev-crew/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdon-dev-crew/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdon-dev-crew/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdon-dev-crew/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdon-dev-crew/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdon-dev-crew/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2017-07-11T08:24:47Z","updated_at":"2018-07-18T11:34:28Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [X] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe editor crashes when using \"tree view\" to open a file in a \"project folder\" that is located on a **re**mounted drive.\r\n\r\nPlease note that it is not necessary to actually access the volume (by e.g. opening a file). It seems that the volume disappearing/reappearing is enough for the editor to crash.\r\n\r\nAlso note that this behavior is **not** present when using File -> Open on the volume. Hence I believe it is related to the \"tree view\".\r\n\r\nCrash logs from _Scenario 2_ has been attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n[e0003a1c-b264-414b-849c-96d6ce864538.txt](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1138162/e0003a1c-b264-414b-849c-96d6ce864538.txt)\r\n[operation_log.txt](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1138163/operation_log.txt)\r\n[e0003a1c-b264-414b-849c-96d6ce864538.zip](https://github.com/atom/atom/files/1138171/e0003a1c-b264-414b-849c-96d6ce864538.zip)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nNote that this crash is reproducible in both _safe_ and _regular_ mode.\r\n\r\n#### Scenario 1:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the volume is **not** already a \"project folder\" in Atom.\r\n2. Mount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n3. Start Atom.\r\n3. Add a \"project folder\" pointing to the mounted volume.\r\n4. Unmount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n5. Remount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n6. Open any file from the mounted volume.\r\n\r\n#### Scenario 2:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the volume **is** already a \"project folder\" in Atom.\r\n2. Mount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n3. Start Atom.\r\n4. Unmount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n5. Remount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n6. Open any file from the mounted volume.\r\n\r\n#### Scenario 3:\r\n\r\nThis is my daily usage scenario.\r\nThe volume has been automatically unmounted the the end of the day.\r\nAt the beginning of each work day, I wake the computer from sleep mode.\r\n\r\n1. Make sure the volume **is** already a \"project folder\" in Atom.\r\n2. Mount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n3. Start Atom.\r\n4. Unmount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n5. Put the computer to sleep (and go home for the day).\r\n6. Wake up the computer.\r\n7. Remount the volume in DiskCryptor.\r\n8. Open any file from the mounted volume.\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior:\r\n\r\nThe editor should not crash when opening a file on a volume that was first mounted, then unmounted and finally remounted.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior:\r\n\r\nThe editor crashes when trying to open any file on a **re**mounted volume.\r\nThis is regardless of whether any file (on any volume) was opened or not.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduces how often:\r\n\r\nEvery time the scenario is repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n`atom --version`\r\nAtom    : 1.18.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.15\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n\r\nThis is the current version I'm using, but this problem has been present much, much longer than this.

This can be used to back off of work, for example.\r\n\r\nAfter talking to @nathansobo and @maxbrunsfeld, we decided the best way forward was to be able to use IntersectionObserver for this…but there are some issues.\r\n\r\nThe first is that—in its current iteration, at least—it doesn't seem to observe when visibility changes as a result of being masked by an `overflow: hidden` parent, which is how docks do it. (See [pen][1].)\r\n\r\nTo work around this, I put together this commit which toggles the `display` of the wrapper element when the dock is shown and completely masked. This guarantees that the IntersectionObserver will broadcast notifications at the appropriate time. However, this too has an issue: the `intersectionRatio` property (which I'd assume people would use to determine if the element was visible) is `0` at the beginning of the show animation. This kinda makes sense because, well, yeah, it isn't actually shown at all yet at the point when the animation to show it starts. I'm assuming that this is why the [`isIntersecting`][2] property was added (but I'm a n00b wrt the API so maybe not). After some playing around, though, I discovered that there was a way to distinguish between the visible and hidden states as, in the case of the item being shown, the `width + height` was nonzero.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote up some tests to verify the behavior and they pass…\r\n\r\nbut then I ran my tests without my dock changes and they still pass. That would seem to imply that the `overflow: hidden` masking _is_ actually triggering an IntersectionObserver notification?? 😖 (It doesn't if you observe the tree view and toggle the dock.)\r\n\r\n@nathansobo @as-cii Any guidance you could give about this inconsistent IntersectionObserver behavior would be super appreciated.\r\n\r\n[1]:

This means that files that are followed by trailing whitespace in .gitignore/exclude always show up as new.\r\n\r\nObviously no one is going to create such files on purpose. I only got bitten by this due to Windows being Windows and adding a trailing whitespace when I innocently did a simple `echo` command. 😛\r\n\r\nI checked the git-diff package first and saw that the actual calculation is implemented in Atom using the git-utils npm package, which I think uses libgit2. This might be an issue in libgit2 or it's usage in git-utils or it might be an issue in the way Atom is using git-utils.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1.

I want to access this terminal using Atom. There are some packages which report to do this on Mac and/or Linux, but nothing that I've found for Windows. I think Atom should have shell functionality built in like Sublime Text or Microsoft Visual Studio Code. The later even allows you to choose which shell to use based on which shells are installed, including windows power shell, CMD, or bash.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Open Atom\r\n2. Write Code\r\n3. Go to commit\r\n4. Nowhere to commit\r\n5. Have to open separate terminal window\r\n6. Be sad\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n1. Press some sort of key combo (whether ctrl+` or ctrl+Shift+P and type Terminal)\r\n2. get access to terminal in window or pane\r\n3. Terminal automatically changes directory to current directory of file that you're working on\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n1. Nothing (currently)\r\n2. Have to open terminal app seperately an change directory manually\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n1.17\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\nPlease consult Microsoft's Visual Studio Code editor for how to implement an integrated terminal well\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14465","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14465/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14465/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14465/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14465","id":229513793,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMjk1MTM3OTM=","number":14465,"title":"`Dock.destroy()` leaves part of the UI of the Dock behind and then exceptions happen","user":{"login":"lee-dohm","id":1038121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzgxMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1038121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm","html_url":"https://github.com/lee-dohm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-05-17T23:19:57Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T23:19:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI am able to destroy a Dock without its contents being destroyed.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Following the build instructions in the documentation for linux, the image will be built with alle the requirements for building atom. At the same time, I added a little documentation for how to build and use the image.\r\n\r\nDifference from the original Dockerfile image is the ADD and WORKDIR instructions in it, I decided to remove this and instead instruct to mount atom in the docker run command as the filesystem can change. \r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain what other alternates were considered and why the proposed version was selected -->\r\n\r\n1. One might consider adding ADD and WORKDIR instructions back to Dockerfile.\r\n2. #14225 only fixes the current failures with the current docker setup, and can be considered an alternative to this PR.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain why this functionality should be in atom/atom as opposed to a package -->\r\n\r\nBecause it expands on features in core.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->\r\n\r\nDocker makes it easy to build atom on any system that have Docker installed, without the need to handle dependencies for atom itself.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the possible side-effects or negative impacts of the code change? -->\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, as I do not know to what extent the Dockerfile is used in core or what purpose it had originally.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n<!-- Enter any applicable Issues here -->\r\n\r\nFixes #14394 \r\nFixes #14224\r\nCloses #14225\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14388","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14388/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14388/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14388/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14388","id":227838214,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMjc4MzgyMTQ=","number":14388,"title":"Opening directory with spaces and trailing slash opens invalid file","user":{"login":"Arcanemagus","id":427137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzEzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/427137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arcanemagus","html_url":"https://github.com/Arcanemagus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arcanemagus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arcanemagus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arcanemagus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arcanemagus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arcanemagus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arcanemagus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arcanemagus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arcanemagus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arcanemagus/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":1109084087,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDg0MDg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/d%20%E2%AC%86%EF%B8%8F","name":"d ⬆️","color":"d1d1d1","default":false},{"id":1109084562,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDg0NTYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/i%20%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F","name":"i ⬇️","color":"ededed","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false},{"id":1109083354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA5MDgzMzU0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/v%20%E2%AC%87%EF%B8%8F","name":"v ⬇️","color":"ededed","default":false},{"id":62363277,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjM2MzI3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-05-10T23:28:24Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T18:48:51Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIf you attempt to open a directory using a path with spaces in it, and include the trailing `\\`, Atom opens to the parent directory with an empty \"file\" of the directory name with a `\"` on the end.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

I wanted to kick a little feature request your way, if it's not too much trouble. I've noticed that in the beta build of Atom, reopening a project in a window with a preexisting tab gives one the option to discard Atom's autosaved project state. I was wondering if it wouldn't be more consistent with the \"Restore Previous Windows on Start\" setting if, when \"restore windows\" was flagged `false`, opening any project---from the menu, via drag-and-drop, from the CLI, from a project management package---automatically dropped its state on the floor.\r\n\r\nI'm ultimately trying to get back to a world like the one I enjoyed when setting `hot_exit` to `false` in Sublime Text, wherein projects never remember expanded directories or opened tabs. (Unsaved buffers are another story: losing those was a part of the deal with Sublime, but Atom's behavior could in theory be gentler there.) Nineish times out of ten, rather than dropping me helpfully where I was working six minutes ago, the state restoration drops me annoyingly where I was working six weeks ago; it's easier just to get back to where I was on my own.\r\n\r\nThe behavior is _so close_ to what I'm looking for in `1.17.0-beta3`, _except_ that reopening a project in a clean window always restores its tabs (which focus themselves in the Tree View as I close them, ack):\r\n\r\n![screenflow](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2207980/25434235/84b25d5e-2a59-11e7-9d2e-4a45d685fadc.gif)\r\n\r\nCan't imagine this being super-high-priority by any stretch, but I also don't quite have the Atom-fu to tackle it on my own. Would be grateful if someone looking for an easy PR would consider it. :pray:\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Open a whole mess'a tabs in an Atom project window.\r\n2. Close the project without explicitly closing your tabs.\r\n3. Open a new window and reopen that selfsame project.\r\n4. Tabs. Why did it have to be tabs.\r\n\r\n**Suggested behavior:** When \"Restore Previous Windows on Start\" is disabled, Atom should discard all preexisting project state---including opened tabs.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Atom selectively remembers some preexisting project state regardless of the setting---including opened tabs.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n```\r\n❯ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.17.0-beta3\r\nElectron: 1.3.14\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ apm --version\r\napm  1.17.0\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 6.9.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.13\r\ngit 2.12.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType\r\nSoftware:\r\n\r\n    System Software Overview:\r\n\r\n      System Version: macOS 10.12.4 (16E195)\r\n      Kernel Version: Darwin 16.5.0\r\n      Boot Volume: Macintosh HD\r\n      Boot Mode: Normal\r\n      Computer Name: Zbornak\r\n      User Name: Daniel P.

bar just gets ignored.  This is surprising because that's not how dragging works in the main window.\r\n\r\nThis is related to this excellent PR: https://github.com/atom/tabs/pull/252\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open a project\r\n2. Create a new window with `cmd-shift-N`\r\n3. Drag a tab from the project to the window you just opened\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Ideally, you'd see the shaded regions allowing you to open a new pane left/right/top...  But I'd settle for a drop in the content area working.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The drag is ignored.  You must hit the tab bar exactly for it to work.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** 100%\r\n\r\n![bug3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1776/25256002/af8eb80e-25e2-11e7-9f14-9629488d2fce.gif)\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line.

Create a file / open a file **in Atom** whose location is `D:/a.cpp`.\r\n2. **In Atom**, create another file and add arbitrary things in it, then open the `Save File` dialog. **DO NOT INTERACT WITH ATOM AT THE MOMENT.**\r\n3. **IN EXPLORER OR CMD, WHERE YOU WOULD NOT INTERACT WITH ATOM**, rename `D:/a.cpp` to `D:/b.cpp`.\r\n4. **In the Save File dialog**, there should only be a file `b.cpp` on Drive D.\r\n5. **In the Save File dialog**, save the new (empty) file as `D:/a.cpp`.\r\n6. **Currently in Atom**, both open tabs should appear as `b.cpp - D:/`.\r\n7. **IN ATOM**, saving any of the two files would result in the other having its contents change into this one.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The first file should turn its name to `b.cpp`, while the newly saved file should retain its expected name `a.cpp`.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Both files turn into `b.cpp`, and are duplicates of the same *file handle*.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** **This can be reproduced at a rate of 100%, regardless of the file names.**\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n**Affects Atom versions `1.8.x` through `1.16.0`, as far as I am concerned.**\r\n\r\nOperating system: Windows 10.0.14393.\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI've never read any of the related code, and decided that there's something to do with the file system journal. Probably this requires a big fix.\r\n\r\n**To regulators:** Change the issue title if you consider it inappropriate.\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14240","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14240/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14240/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14240/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14240","id":222248731,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMjIyNDg3MzE=","number":14240,"title":"Atom crash opening a folder, adding a project folder or dragging folder","user":{"login":"enrique2210","id":27702889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzAyODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/27702889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enrique2210","html_url":"https://github.com/enrique2210","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enrique2210/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enrique2210/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enrique2210/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enrique2210/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enrique2210/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enrique2210/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enrique2210/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enrique2210/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enrique2210/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":171329633,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzEzMjk2MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-reproduction","name":"needs-reproduction","color":"009800","default":false},{"id":62363277,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjM2MzI3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":22,"created_at":"2017-04-17T22:25:22Z","updated_at":"2017-12-21T23:47:58Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe IDE crash when I drag a folder, use the option to open a folder or adding a folder \r\nI'm on a Windows10 Home edition x64\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

However, this data loss scenario can also happen to a file with a project folder, without unusual or unintended behaviors such as crashing Atom, opening multiple windows of Atom, etc. It can be reproduced by the following steps.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open Atom with project folder A and make some change. Be sure that the changes are not saved.\r\n2. Close Atom.\r\n3. Open Atom with project folder B.\r\n4. Add project folder A, and then remove project folder B.\r\n5. Close Atom.\r\n6. Open Atom with project folder A. (Or possibly with no project folder)\r\n7. Now the changes are gone!\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The changes must be preserved at a certain step. If Atom handles unsaved buffers separate from project folders, the changes should be shown in step 3. This was what I expected (as Sublime Text does) before I search for the related issues and find out that Atom integrates the editor's state with project folders. Since Atom integrates them, the changes in step 1 may be expected reappear in either step 4 (when adding project folder A) or step 6.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Data loss\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Always\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line.

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\nPlease advise on a test I can write. I have not been able to successfully compile HEAD so I'm not sure if I can test or if this code is complete. It is a small patch so feel free to just fork it. Note that I did manually test the concept by using the --socket-path option on startup and writing the socket path in the same way that it would be constructed in this code.\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nAtom connects to a socket to determine if it is already running\r\nand if it should launch a new window in the same process.\r\nThis socket is named with the user's name but ignores the user's\r\ndisplay. If a user has multiple displays, such as running a\r\nremote display server, Atom will pop up the new window on the display\r\nthat it was first started on.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the display name to the socket name if it exists\r\nin the env. Because a separate socket is being opened Atom does\r\nthe correct thing and launches on the display it was started on.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nNo alternatives. On linux it should be using D-Bus to avoid these lifecycle/session issues but this is good enough with the benefit that it will work across different Unix like envs.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nAtom windows should open up on the display they are started on.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nUsers who remote into a different display (such as I have to do for work) will be able to start Atom without first stopping Atom processes running on a different display.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nNone. This is proper behavior. Applications should always respect the environment they are started in.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14083","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14083/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14083/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14083/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14083","id":217763186,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMTc3NjMxODY=","number":14083,"title":"Copying or cutting without selecting text results in unexpected paste behaviour","user":{"login":"jdw1996","id":17225098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjI1MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17225098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdw1996","html_url":"https://github.com/jdw1996","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdw1996/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdw1996/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdw1996/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdw1996/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdw1996/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdw1996/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdw1996/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdw1996/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdw1996/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":8,"created_at":"2017-03-29T04:41:50Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T04:44:34Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"<!--\r\n\r\nHave you read Atom's Code of Conduct?

Place your cursor on any line in the file, at any place in the line, and press Ctrl-v.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** [What you expect to happen]\r\n\r\nI would expect the copied text to be pasted where the cursor is, without any newlines being pasted.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happens]\r\n\r\nInstead, the copied text is added to the beginning of the line and, if the cursor is not on the last line of the file, it moves down a line.\r\n\r\nHere's a simple example, where I copy `a`, type `b`, then paste repeatedly:\r\n\r\n![copy-paste-bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17225098/24438786/e53b6fd8-1417-11e7-9fd5-62bacd7a0fec.gif)\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** [What percentage of the time does it reproduce?]\r\n\r\nThis happens every time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom    : 1.15.0\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  : 52.0.2743.82\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n$ apm --version\r\napm  1.15.3\r\nnpm  3.10.5\r\nnode 4.4.5 x64\r\npython 2.7.12\r\ngit 2.7.4\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm using Ubuntu 16.04, but I've seen the same issue in Windows 7 as well."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14074","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14074/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14074/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/14074/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/14074","id":217284044,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMTcyODQwNDQ=","number":14074,"title":"Uncaught AssertionError: 2337 == 0","user":{"login":"ndeniche","id":4029245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjkyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4029245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndeniche","html_url":"https://github.com/ndeniche","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndeniche/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndeniche/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndeniche/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndeniche/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndeniche/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndeniche/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndeniche/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndeniche/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ndeniche/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":211058624,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTEwNTg2MjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/uncaught-exception","name":"uncaught-exception","color":"e11d21","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2017-03-27T15:28:24Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T20:57:38Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"[Enter steps to reproduce:]\r\n\r\n1.

It was only after some trial and error and searching through the docs that I found the reason for the confusion was having multiple sources to each snippet. I feel this will make it a lit clearer.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nClearer understanding for new users who aren't familiar with Atom.

Atom nicely follows the link, but the fact that the destination file isn't \".c\" causes it to not do any syntax highlighting or other language-specific stuff.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if it made that decision based on the name of the symlink, or perhaps only when the destintation file is of unknown type, or perhaps with an option setting.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Find, say, \"sample.c\" in your source directory.\r\n2. Rename it \"sample.c.notype\".\r\n3. Create a symbolic link \"sample.c\" to point to it.\r\n4.

Launch Atom in a directory underneath your home directory from Terminal using `atom .`\r\n1. Close any open files\r\n1. Right-click the proxy icon\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Proxy icon stack should show a correct file path\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Proxy icon shows `~` in the file path\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nYou can get this information from copy and pasting the output of `atom --version` and `apm --version` from the command line.

Any pull request that does not include enough information to be reviewed in a timely manner may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.\r\n* All new code requires tests to ensure against regressions\r\n\r\n### Description of the Change\r\n\r\nThis is one out of four parts necessary to move encoding auto-detection logic into core, the other three being https://github.com/atom/node-pathwatcher/pull/120, https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/220, and https://github.com/atom/encoding-selector/pull/42.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this PR adds the option in the config schema to turn on encoding auto-detection and sets up the logic to detect the encoding whenever a file is opened.  It does _not_ actually do any detection (that is handled by PathWatcher).  The existing file encoding option is used as a fallback for when auto-detection fails.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be the third one to be merged, after https://github.com/atom/text-buffer/pull/220.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nThis design was based on how the existing `setEncoding` and `getEncoding` methods were implemented.  An alternate design would be to move the actual detection logic into atom/atom, though that feels unnecessary.  Furthermore, `detectEncoding` could be changed to `detectAndSetEncoding`, though I think some package authors may want to only detect the encoding.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nWe already offer the option to set a default encoding, but the ability to auto-detect the encoding is far more useful for people who regularly work with files with different encodings.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nThere will be no need to have to manually select the auto-detect option for each file.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nI can't think of any.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nCloses atom/encoding-selector#24\r\nSupersedes and closes #12127\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @tinymins for starting the implementation.  Most of my work was based off of his, though unfortunately I couldn't cherry-pick his commit over to my branch because his branch had been deleted."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13927","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13927/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13927/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13927/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13927","id":211816308,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTA5MDY2MTkw","number":13927,"title":"fix

It adds a method to the parameter of the `::onWillDestroyPaneItem` callback named `prevent` which allows packages to prevent a tab from closing by adding an event listener via `::onWillDestroyPaneItem`\r\n\r\n### Alternate Designs\r\n\r\nAn alternative for the requested feature overall isn't really present, as the previous implementation would close the tab no matter what or request the user to safe in case of unsaved changes. Both of these are unwanted behaviour as described in #12376.\r\n\r\nAs for alternative ways to implement the functionality, I considered `prevent` to be a (boolean) value instead of a function. However, this seemed not such a good choice mainly because I find it more intuitive to use as a function, but also because JavaScript can't enforce the value to be a boolean.\r\n\r\n### Why Should This Be In Core?\r\n\r\nAs explained in #12376, the problem is that it isn't part of the core. As of now it is nearly impossible to implement this as a package, and non of the solutions I could think of are even remotely elegant (e.g. recording what tab(s) closed and reopening them after they've been closed).\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\nIt will help developers of packages prevent the unwanted closing of \"special\" tabs e.g. when \"Close all tabs\" is called by the user. This has, for example, been requested in [this](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/pinned-tabs-for-atom/issues/20) issue on one of my own packages.\r\n\r\n### Possible Drawbacks\r\n\r\nWhen used incorrectly this functionality could make closing tabs impossible for users. However, simply disabling the package that uses this functionality incorrectly will solve the problem.\r\n\r\n### Applicable Issues\r\n\r\nN/A"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13760","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13760/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13760/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13760/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13760","id":205733098,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTA0OTAwNzcy","number":13760,"title":"Open empty editor as a pending pane item","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjYwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3MjI5NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2017-02-06T22:55:44Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T16:47:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13760","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13760","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13760.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13760.patch"},"body":"### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Filling out the template is required.

Description\r\n\r\nHi, @franklinrt logged https://github.com/mupchrch/split-diff/issues/91. Atom core is throwing a deprecation warning when running `atom.workspace.paneForItem(atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()).splitRight({items:[atom.workspace.buildTextEditor()]})` in my package. This seems like a reasonable bit of code to run, so I am logging this issue.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI just updated Atom to 1.13.1 and I am getting a deprecation warning from Atom API code that seems reasonable.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Open Atom\r\nStep 2: run `atom.workspace.paneForItem(atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()).splitRight({items:[atom.workspace.buildTextEditor()]})` in dev tools console\r\n\r\nAt this point I receive the following deprecation warning:\r\n\r\n```atom core (1 deprecation)\r\n\r\nAssigning editor 302's height explicitly via position: 'absolute' and an assigned top and bottom implicitly assigns the autoHeight property to false on the editor.

I recognise that the problem is caused by a package external to Atom. I believe that this is a valid issue despite this. I have met the other prerequisites.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen a UI theme is selected with a `styles/ui-variables.less` file which would cause the Less compiler to error, and Atom is reloaded, the editor fails to load, and the window remains an empty white box.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Clone [atom-community/ui-theme-template](https://github.com/atom-community/ui-theme-template).\r\n2. Append `#` on a new line to `styles/ui-variables.less`. Alternatively, `@foo: @bar;` can be appended, where `@bar` is undefined. This also reproduces the issue. \r\n3. Run `apm link --dev` in the root of the repository.\r\n4. Open Atom in developer mode (`atom --dev`), navigate to the themes section of the settings screen, and select \"Ui Theme Template\" from the UI themes dropdown list.\r\n5. Reload Atom in developer mode (I tried both `ctrl + alt + r`, and simply closing Atom and re-opening it with `atom --dev`).\r\n\r\nI have only reproduced the problem in developer mode. I have not attempted to reproduce the problem in Atom's normal mode, as I fear being unable to reverse it.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The editor loads.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** The editor does not load, and the window remains an empty white box. The Chromium developer tools automatically open to the console.\r\n\r\n**Reproduces how often:** Every time.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.12.9\r\nElectron: 1.3.13\r\nChrome  :

setting when overriding `nonWordCharacters` in a scope-specific setting since `nonWordCharacters` is a single string.  That means it's an all-or-nothing change, rather than being able to add or remove characters as necessary.\r\n\r\nFor example, $ is a valid identifier for many languages. However the default `nonWordCharacters` includes `$`, which means attempting to double-click to select a variable with `$` in it will only select part of it. The best way to fix this currently is to override `nonWordCharacters` in the language settings by copying/pasting the default value and removing the `$`. However, this totally disregards any customizations the user may have made.\r\n\r\n**Possible solutions**:\r\n* The best one I could think of is adding some type of new setting that takes scenarios like these into account.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nN/A - this is an API limitation.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\nAtom    : 1.14.0-dev-d3d06fb\r\nElectron: 1.4.7\r\nChrome  : 53.0.2785.143\r\nNode    : 6.5.0\r\n```\r\non Windows 10 x64.\r\n\r\n/cc @nathansobo"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13385","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13385/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13385/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13385/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13385","id":193384575,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0OTY0NTIwNTM=","number":13385,"title":"Modified keymap 'ctrl-q' to save files before quiting","user":{"login":"pedro-c","id":9059178,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTkxNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/9059178?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-c","html_url":"https://github.com/pedro-c","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-c/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-c/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-c/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-c/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-c/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-c/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-c/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-c/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pedro-c/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-12-04T23:28:03Z","updated_at":"2017-03-04T17:03:52Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/13385","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13385","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13385.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/13385.patch"},"body":"This discussion (https://discuss.atom.io/t/quit-confirmation/5572) and the issue #6082 discusses how useful would be having a warning message before quitting because, sometimes when multiple buffers and multiple windows are opened, user wants to close current buffer in current window by pressing Ctrl+W.

I noticed four distinct problematic behaviours:\r\n\r\n- it takes around three dozen presses of the left or right arrow keys to step into a half-dozen-letter Syriac word, through it, and back out of it again\r\n- it is almost impossible to place the cursor at the intended Syriac letter using the mouse\r\n- once you click into a Syriac word, the cursor disappears\r\n- (this one is minor) Syriac letters don't obey the letter width of fixed-width fonts such as Courier New\r\n\r\nTaken together, these issues are unfortunately a deal-breaker for me. I also have to edit documents combining other RTL and LTR languages and it is day-to-day work for me. This is unfortunate, because I really like that Atom always keeps the document left-aligned instead of deciding alignment line-by-line as e.g. gedit does.\r\n\r\nI suspect a connection of what I'm experiencing here to what is described in #4682.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. open atom\r\n2. paste below text into the editing area\r\n3. position cursor before the first letter\r\n4. keep right arrow key pressed; notice time it takes the cursor to move through non-Latin parts of the document\r\n5. try other things described above\r\n\r\n```\r\nOlafbeṯ I - *Alphabet I* - ܐܳܠܰܦܒܶܬܼ ܐ.

The aim of this issue is to explicitly state what the bottlenecks are and, where possible, suggest ideas on how to solve them. Profiles were taken after disabling all the 3rd party packages.\r\n\r\n* Bootstrap Node.<br>**Cost:** ~ 100ms.<br>**Savings:** N/A.<br>**Difficulty:** Medium/Hard.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 13 53 58](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20390197/ff02edee-accd-11e6-890e-d5fbde25e2d9.png)\r\n\r\n  This section involves setting up Node and is standard for all the projects. The bottom line is that it would require a change in Electron, hence why I chose Medium/Hard as the difficulty. It might be worth exploring solutions with the Electron team as well as talking to the Node team, understanding if there are plans to improve this in the future.\r\n\r\n  An interesting observation is that most of it is spent in requiring modules, so maybe Electron/Node could employ some of the techniques we plan to use for userland requires (see below).\r\n\r\n* Requiring modules.<br>**Cost:** ~ 350-400 ms.<br>**Savings:** 90-100%.<br>**Difficulty:** Medium/Hard.\r\n\r\n  This sections concerns the time spent in searching, compiling and executing JavaScript files. I haven't provided a screenshot of the CPU profile because this cost is spread across many function calls.\r\n\r\n  So long as modules don't access Node core modules or DOM APIs at require-time, we should be able to use v8 snapshots to do most of the work during `script/build`. This means we would need to restructure some packages to stop using those APIs, but it should be doable. Last week we have been working on proving the feasibility of this approach and it seems like we could apply it to Atom.\r\n\r\n* Constructing `AtomEnvironment`.<br>**Cost:** ~ 100-110ms.<br>**Savings:** 75-80%.<br>**Difficulty:** Medium.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 14 08 52](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20390488/6c9aceca-accf-11e6-8630-5da169a2a984.png)\r\n\r\n  The above chart breaks down into several sub-tasks. Some of them can be executed upfront in the snapshotting phase:\r\n    * Creating objects like `Workspace`, `TextEditorRegistry`, etc.(~ 10ms).\r\n    * `Config.setSchema` (~ 7ms).\r\n    * `ThemeManager.loadBaseStylesheets` (~ 19ms).\r\n    * `KeymapManager.loadBundledKeymaps` (~ 11ms)\r\n\r\n  Others need to happen at runtime, although we can make them asynchronous and avoid blocking the main thread:\r\n    * `ApplicationDelegate.disableZoom` (~ 9ms).\r\n    * `AtomEnvironment.registerDefaultCommands` (~ 7ms).\r\n    * `AtomEnvironment.installWindowEventHandler` (~ 7ms).\r\n    * `HistoryManager.loadState` (~ 25ms).\r\n    * `Config.loadUserConfig` (~ 5ms).\r\n\r\n* Loading Packages.<br>**Cost:** ~ 50-60ms.<br>**Savings:** 90-100%.<br>**Difficulty:** Medium.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 13 15 15](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20390867/f4c94866-acd0-11e6-8626-bff3f7d54513.png)\r\n\r\n  Loading packages involves reading their style sheets and their configuration schemas. The image above is the typical chart of a single `Package.load` call. At least for bundled packages, we have all the information at compile-time and we should be able to bake it into the snapshot.\r\n\r\n* Environment Deserialization.<br>**Cost:** ~ 50-60ms.<br>**Savings:** 70%.<br>**Difficulty:** N/A.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 13 16 21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20391116/463b8d7a-acd2-11e6-9e05-4077e194acb9.png)\r\n\r\n  Deserializing the environment is something that needs to happen at runtime but, as the chart above shows, the dominator in that stack trace is `GitRepository`. In particular, it might be worth revisiting `openSubmodules` and `refreshStatus`: the former can probably be deferred at a later moment in time, while the latter is already asynchronous and is probably slow because of the overhead of creating a `Task`.\r\n\r\n* Activating Packages.<br>**Cost:** ~ 300ms.<br>**Savings:** N/A<br>**Difficulty:** Medium/Hard.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 14 39 47](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20391597/6a1adc30-acd4-11e6-93bf-aa929f773678.png)\r\n\r\n  Estimating savings for this section is somewhat tricky, as a considerable amount of time is spent in requiring modules (which has been accounted for in a previous section). However, we think we could further reduce the cost of it by splitting core packages activation into two phases (snapshot and runtime), offloading as much work as possible to the snapshot one.\r\n\r\n* Refreshing less cache and reloading base style sheets.<br>**Cost:** ~ 20ms.<br>**Savings:** 90-100%<br>**Difficulty:** N/A.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 14 55 48](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20391951/04a732c0-acd6-11e6-9e21-41c2bd840d7c.png)\r\n\r\n  The first thing that is suspicious is that this stack trace feels redundant, as we do a similar thing when instantiating `AtomEnvironment`. Anyways, this is all information we have at compile time, so the only cost we should pay at runtime is to add the proper CSS to the `<head>` element.\r\n\r\n* First Layout<br>**Cost:** ~ 250ms.<br>**Savings:** N/A<br>**Difficulty:** Hard.\r\n\r\n  ![screen shot 2016-11-17 at 14 59 03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/482957/20392134/c837d6e0-acd6-11e6-8404-97abc06feaf1.png)\r\n\r\n  This is the first layout that Atom performs after loading and it takes a pretty huge amount of time. Unfortunately, we cannot inspect what is happening under the hood that causes this layout to be slow. We suspect it might be due to our use of flexbox, but at the same time we feel like it might be worth capturing a native profile of Electron and inspecting the actual native calls that are being executed.\r\n\r\n* Main Process.<br>**Cost:** ~ 600ms.<br>**Savings:** N/A<br>**Difficulty:** N/A.\r\n\r\n  Profiling the main process is somewhat trickier than profiling the renderer process, as we don't have direct access to the dev tools. However, I have estimated that we spend `~ 600ms` to get from the first line of code in the main process to the first line of code in the renderer process. This section probably deserves an entire issue, as we are aware that the main process needs a overhaul. However it's worth noting that it significantly contributes to startup time, although it's unclear how much of it is Atom's fault and how much of it is due to Electron.\r\n\r\n/cc: @atom/maintainers "},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13249","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13249/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13249/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13249/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13249","id":189885204,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxODk4ODUyMDQ=","number":13249,"title":"Custom title bar on Windows/Linux","user":{"login":"erroid","id":10036579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM2NTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/10036579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erroid","html_url":"https://github.com/erroid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erroid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erroid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erroid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erroid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erroid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erroid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erroid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erroid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erroid/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":258255692,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTgyNTU2OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/electron","name":"electron","color":"A5ECFA","default":false},{"id":97310502,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzMxMDUwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/help-wanted","name":"help-wanted","color":"159818","default":false},{"id":97577987,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzU3Nzk4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":62363277,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjM2MzI3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":42,"created_at":"2016-11-16T23:38:41Z","updated_at":"2018-10-29T00:41:48Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Using dark theme and having white title bar is not nice.

Description\r\n\r\nWith soft tabs enabled I try to align text on the right of some other text. Since I am using soft tabs I expect the tab key to insert a number of spaces sufficient to move the cursor on the screen to the next tab stop.  This works if the line does not have any hard tabs on it already.  But it is wrong when there are hard tabs to the left of the cursor position on the same line.\r\n\r\nThis problem is surely caused by two different interpretations of the cursor column position.  One interpretation is the byte position in the buffer, and the other is the screen position as rendered.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new file.\r\n2. Enable hard tabs, tab spacing 8.\r\n3. Insert this text using the TAB key for <TAB>s:\r\n```\r\n     <TAB>buf =<TAB>nullptr;\r\n     <TAB>a =<TAB>zero;\r\n```\r\nThe zero and the nullptr should line up, as expected.\r\n![With all tabs, text aligns correctly](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/123908/20231736/cf05447a-a818-11e6-816c-da5e16b8d2fd.png)\r\n\r\n4. Change the editor settings to soft tabs.\r\n5. Delete the last tab just before `zero` and press <TAB> again.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** The 2nd line should have three spaces before `zero`, and the `zero` and `nullptr` text should be visually aligned on the screen.\r\n![Expected behavior](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/123908/20231747/dd43e15e-a818-11e6-9022-34f076957000.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Only two spaces were inserted by the soft tab and the text does not align.\r\n![Actual behavior](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/123908/20231753/e988ead6-a818-11e6-839b-bcd34742c1b1.png)\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nRunning Ubuntu Linux 16.10 with Atom 1.11.2.\r\n\r\n    $ atom --version\r\n    Atom    : 1.11.2\r\n    Electron: 0.37.8\r\n    Chrome  : 49.0.2623.75\r\n    Node    : 5.10.0\r\n\r\n    $ apm --version\r\n    apm  1.12.5\r\n    npm  3.10.5\r\n    node 4.4.5\r\n    python 2.7.12\r\n    git 2.7.4\r\n\r\n    $ uname -a\r\n    Linux phord-X1 4.7.6-040706-generic #201609300531 SMP Fri Sep 30 09:33:47 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13148","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13148/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13148/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/13148/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/13148","id":187462620,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxODc0NjI2MjA=","number":13148,"title":"Failed to remove '/usr/local/bin/atom'","user":{"login":"smith-kyle","id":5474861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5474861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith-kyle","html_url":"https://github.com/smith-kyle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith-kyle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith-kyle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith-kyle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith-kyle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith-kyle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith-kyle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith-kyle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith-kyle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smith-kyle/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":98445015,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5ODQ0NTAxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-11-05T00:00:30Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T23:48:30Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Description\r\n\r\nI'm seeing a misleading error message when cancelling installation of the shell commands.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5474861/20025751/ecfaa84a-a2ae-11e6-9754-d0db1cb2962d.png)\r\n\r\nThis is misleading because `usr/local/bin/atom` doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

This can lead to surprising / counterintuitive results.\r\n\r\nI ran into this with the `auto-detect-indentation` package, which tries to manage the settings of `softTabs` and `tabLength`. The steps-to-repro below are with respect to that package, and you can refer to the bug I mentioned above for a description of what I'd expect to be the interaction between the core's idea of per-type settings and what the package is trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nI _think_ the problem boils down to the fact that <https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/text-editor-registry.js#L333-L343> often (always?) ends up running _after_ third-party packages are `activate`d (or something along those lines). In addition, it may make sense to distinguish the act of calling `editor.update` as \"action taken by the core\" vs. other reasons. In this case, the package in question might want to behave differently in these different cases. (But please take this all with a big grain of salt, as I'm not super-familiar with the Atom codebase.)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install the package `auto-detect-indentation`.\r\n2. Put the following in your `config.cson`:\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   \".js.source\":\r\n    editor:\r\n      tabLength: 8\r\n      tabType: \"hard\"\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Open up a `.js` file with blatant two-space indentation.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe editor is set to two-space indentation.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe editor is set to eight-space hard tab indentation. If you watch carefully, you can sometimes see the indentation status briefly flash \"2 Spaces\" before getting thwacked to \"Tabs (8 wide)\".\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ atom --version\r\nAtom

However I do have some painpoints related to how the selection stops.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Write this on an empty editor.\n\n```\nthis is   an example\nthis_is_an_example\nTHIS_IS_AN_EXAMPLE\nTHIS_is_anExample\nthis_is   an_example\nthisIsAnExample\nthis__is___an__example\n```\n1. Position your cursor on the beginning of the file and execute `editor:select-to-end-of-word` 4 times, take note of the behavior.\n2. Position your cursor back to the beginning of the file.\n3. Execute `editor:select-to-next-subword-boundary` 4 times.\n4. If there are more lines, go to the beginning of the next line and go to step 4 until all lines are processed.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nEvery line had the same behavior on step 4 compared to what happened on step 2.\n\n**Actual behavior:** [What actually happened]\nOn step 4...\n- :x:  Line 1 stopped at spaces which is ok, but the next execution should select the spaces plus the next word.\n- :white_check_mark: Line 2 behaved just as expected. \n- :x: Line 3 behaved like line 1 but with underscores instead of spaces.\n- :x: Line 4 just like line 1 did the same on the first underscore, but not on the second one.\n     It did stop at the \"camel case\".\n- :x: Line 5 worked as expected selecting the underscores worked, but not the space.\n- :white_check_mark: Line 6 as expected.\n- :white_check_mark: Line 7 same.\n### Versions\n\nAtom    : 1.11.2\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\napm  1.12.5\nnpm  3.10.5\nnode 4.4.5\npython 2.7.6\ngit 1.9.1\nLinux

Both Emacs and Vim provide separate \"Tab Length\" and \"Indent Length\" settings. In Vim, those settings are `tabstop` and `shiftwidth`, respectively. In Emacs, those settings are `tab-width` and `standard-indent`, respectively.\n\nIt is standard practice in our codebase to set `tabstop` to 8, and `shiftwidth` to 4. From what I've seen, many open source codebases (especially C and C++ codebases) follow the same convention. In Atom, however, I'm limited to setting both of these values to either 8 or 4, since Atom only provides a single setting for both of these values: \"Tab Length\".\n\nThis is problematic, because when editing other code in Atom, I'm forced to choose between incorrect display of the code, or incorrect indenting behavior.\n\nFor example, suppose I set Atom's \"Tab Length\" setting to 4. Then I open a file which uses 4-space indent and 8-space tabs. I will see code indented like this (example mocked up from my `magic-reflow` Atom package):\n\n``` js\n    reflow_lines: function*(lines, state) {\n    lines = Array.from(lines);\n\n    if (debug) debug('reflowing:', state, lines);\n\n    // Break the text into blocks, and reflow each block separately.\n    for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; ) {\n        // Blank lines always break blocks.  We must handle them specially\n        // here since they will get swallowed by the rewrap logic otherwise.\n        if (is_blank_line(lines[i])) {\n        yield lines[i];\n        ++i;\n        continue;\n        }\n\n        let [ni, out_lines] = this.consume_block(lines, i, state);\n        if (ni < i + 1) {\n        throw `consume didn't advance (from ${i}) target ${ni}`;\n        }\n        i = ni;\n        yield* out_lines;\n    }\n\n    if (debug) debug('done reflowing');\n    },\n```\n\nAlternatively, I could set \"Tab Length\" to 8, which would cause the code to render correctly, but indentation would behave incorrectly, and I would have to constantly adjust it manually, which very quickly gets annoying.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nI propose the following changes:\n- Limit the existing \"Tab Length\" setting to specify only the visual length (or number of columns) of physical tab characters.\n- Add a new \"Indent Length\" setting, which specifies the visual length of an indentation. This setting is used any time code needs to be indented, to determine how many spaces (or combination of spaces and tabs, if Tab Type is “hard”) to insert.\n\nThis should accommodate users (like myself) who work in codebases where the “Tab Length” is different from the “Indent Length”.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12913","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12913/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12913/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12913/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12913","id":181803354,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxODE4MDMzNTQ=","number":12913,"title":"script\\clean twice fails (cannot find module 'fs-extra')","user":{"login":"50Wliu","id":2766036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjYwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2766036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu","html_url":"https://github.com/50Wliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/50Wliu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":98407029,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5ODQwNzAyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/build-error","name":"build-error","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-10-08T04:13:57Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T12:07:59Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nOriginally reported to me by @Ben3eeE.

I initially reported it in #9677, but without any clue as to why it was not working properly the issue was closed expected.\n\nSo now, let’s enter the main topic. \n\nLet’s say we create a new package, we’re running it in dev mode, and for the moment there’s no deserializers or registered views for that package. \n\nWhen requiring the main module, we will end up passing in [this branch](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/package.coffee#L442-L444) that will set the `getCanDeferMainModuleRequireStorageKey()` flag to `true`.\n\nNow if we start adding deserializers into our package, since the flag is never turned off, the package main module loading will always be deferred on activation as [this condition will always be true](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/package.coffee#L102), resulting in error if the there’s serialized pane items that need to be deserialized. \n\nOf course, as these settings are scoped using the package version, this is generally not an issue with published packages. If serializers or views are added between two versions the local storage keys will be different  and the previous value will be ignored.\n\nHowever, this issue is making developing a package that have serializers seriously complicated as there’s no longer a way to test them in dev mode once we entered that state (unless knowing that this local storage setting must be removed).\n\nA simple solution here is to simply remove the local storage item if we find that the package now has deserializers or registered views that it didn’t have before.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12508","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12508/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12508/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12508/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12508","id":173092289,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNzMwOTIyODk=","number":12508,"title":"File --> Open... not functional after closing editor Window (OS X)","user":{"login":"sijpkes","id":801573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMTU3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/801573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijpkes","html_url":"https://github.com/sijpkes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijpkes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijpkes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijpkes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijpkes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijpkes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijpkes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijpkes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijpkes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sijpkes/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":97310502,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzMxMDUwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/help-wanted","name":"help-wanted","color":"159818","default":false},{"id":98445015,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5ODQ0NTAxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":36,"created_at":"2016-08-25T01:02:43Z","updated_at":"2018-11-01T22:38:53Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"In Atom version 1.9.9 on OS X, when you try to open a Project from the File menu after closing the editor window, the FInder file selection pane does not pop-up as expected.  \n\nTo reproduce this:\n1.

In this case a simple single-file rule has been added to `.gitignore_global` and then negated in the project's `.gitignore` file, which means that it should be tracked in git, and thus, in my mind, is not a \"VCS Ignored Path.\"\n\nNote: I have avoided using `git check-ignore` because of the [rather confusing behavior](https://public-inbox.org/git/1418323355-23935-1-git-send-email-florian.hassanen@gmail.com/) where it returns files that match any gitignore rule, including negated rules, rather than only returning files that will actually be ignored.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\nFile is not available in Fuzzy Finder, Tree View, or other areas that respect the VCS Ignored Paths setting.\n\n<img width=\"637\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-08-17 19 03 58\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/157270/17759600/5f1602c0-64ad-11e6-8819-431c8e02a30a.png\">\n<img width=\"505\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-08-17 19 01 14\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/157270/17759592/3b50e31e-64ad-11e6-8594-6b67e506e37d.png\">\n<img width=\"636\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-08-17 19 05 46\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/157270/17759620/9fb1b360-64ad-11e6-94a9-ba6b8bf9463b.png\">\n<img width=\"505\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-08-17 19 05 39\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/157270/17759621/a218a712-64ad-11e6-9451-b0e0ce4b8469.png\">\n\nI don't know any way to get the array of VCS ignored files from the developer console, otherwise I would've done that instead of using this crude screenshot-based method.\n### Versions\n\nTested on Atom stable & beta on two separate Macs, one running 10.11.6 and one running 10.12 PB5\n\n```\n$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.9.8\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n\n$ atom-beta --version \nAtom    : 1.10.0-beta5\nElectron: 0.37.8\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\nNode    : 5.10.0\n```\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12436","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12436/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12436/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12436/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12436","id":171316120,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0ODE0MDk1ODI=","number":12436,"title":"Pass the menu item when executing menu command","user":{"login":"gekowa","id":1035538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzU1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1035538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gekowa","html_url":"https://github.com/gekowa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gekowa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gekowa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gekowa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gekowa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gekowa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gekowa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gekowa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gekowa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gekowa/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3MjI5NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-08-16T03:28:21Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T16:47:19Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/12436","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12436","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12436.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/12436.patch"},"body":"Pass the menu item when executing menu command so that we could know exactly which menu item triggers the event by interrogating event.detail property.\n\nE.g., Inside a package\n\n``` js\nthis.subscriptions = new CompositeDisposable();\nthis.subscriptions.add(atom.commands.add(\"atom-workspace\", {\n  \"some-command\": (evt) => {\n    console.log(evt.detail);

Just last week I started trying to use Atom on MacOS 10 (Yosemite), and my main interest right now is in the languages ruby and crystal.\n\nWhen Atom.app starts up, it creates a directory \"Atom Crashes\":\n\n``` cr\n# ls -l /tmp/Atom\\ Crashes/\ntotal 8\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 gad  wheel  68 Aug 14 21:42 completed/\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 gad  wheel  68 Aug 14 21:42 new/\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 gad  wheel  68 Aug 14 21:42 pending/\n-rw-r--r--  1 gad  wheel  40 Aug 14 21:46 settings.dat\n```\n\nThe problem is that this is created with a generic name, but it is owned by the active user and no other users can modify it (which **is** how it should be -- in fact, it could be argued that no other users should be allowed to read it).\n\nThe problem comes when I try to switch users in MacOS 10, using fast-user switching.  If I try to start up Atom on a second userid, and if I have the console.app running, I'll see an endless stream of error messages:\n\n``` cr\n<timestamp> PM crashpad_handler[<pid>]: [0814/212739:ERROR:file_io_posix.cc(153)] open /tmp/Atom Crashes/settings.dat: Permission denied\n```\n\nI have to switch back to the first userid, bring up Terminal, and `rm -rf /tmp/Atom*`.  And of course this means that Atom.app cannot be left running on two different sessions at the same time, which is disappointing.\n\nIf Atom is going to create a directory in /tmp, then it should include the userid (or the user's UID) in the name of the directory.  I think the directory should also be created with permissions 700, not 755.\n\nI notice that in MacOS 10, the directory has the attribute:\n\n``` cr\n# ls -ld@ /tmp/Atom\\ Crashes\ndrwxr-xr-x@ 6 gad  wheel  204 Aug 14 21:42 /tmp/Atom Crashes/\n    org.chromium.crashpad.database.initialized    1 \n```\n\nif that helps to track this down.\n\nFWIW:\n\n``` cr\n# atom --version\nAtom    :

text that forces the view to scroll horizontally or vertically, the scrollbar stays at its initial position. The problem seems to only occur if there is no scrollbar present. When trying to achieve the same result when there is already a scrollbar visible, it will work fine.\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Open Atom in safe mode\r\n1. Open a new untitled tab\r\n1. Paste the contents of  [this file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Ben3eeE/6b9a8d5c3fbdd38bda3b70b63617b280/raw/77e0fc174f27160e82bd3c27f2d8182771770fb8/gistfile1.txt) in to the new untitled tab.\r\n1. **Expected:** Scrollbar to be at the bottom since the TextEditor is scrolled to the  bottom. **Acutal:** Scrollbar stays at the top of the file. This bug applies to both vertical and horizontal scrollbars.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** \r\n\r\nThe scrollbar should appear and then indicate that the view has been scrolled.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** \r\n\r\nThe scrollbar didn't indicate that the site was scrolled. It stayed at its initial position on the left.\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\nAtom    : 1.9.5\r\nElectron: 0.37.8\r\nChrome  : 49.0.2623.75\r\nNode    : 5.10.0\r\nmacOS/OSX El Capitan\r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12314","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12314/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12314/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12314/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12314","id":169199848,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNjkxOTk4NDg=","number":12314,"title":"Cursor keeps switching back to pointer instead of i beam","user":{"login":"whaaaley","id":7419947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MTk5NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7419947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whaaaley","html_url":"https://github.com/whaaaley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whaaaley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whaaaley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whaaaley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whaaaley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whaaaley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whaaaley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whaaaley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whaaaley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whaaaley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":98445015,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5ODQ0NTAxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":18,"created_at":"2016-08-03T18:26:08Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T16:11:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n### Description\n\nThe cursor keeps switching back to a pointer instead of an i beam.\n\n[![https://gyazo.com/86f19cdd229d3db894a327cfeb6eee80](https://i.gyazo.com/86f19cdd229d3db894a327cfeb6eee80.gif)](https://gyazo.com/86f19cdd229d3db894a327cfeb6eee80)\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

Admittedly, I've never written specs before, but I'm familiar with Jasmine. Any guidance for writing specs for this would be super helpful.\n### TODO:\n- [ ] Write specs\n- [ ] Cleanup, including old commented code and extra space around new code\n- [ ] Decide if the `home` and `end` keys should act on the screen or buffer line. Currently it's the screen line\n- [ ] Modify new screen line functions in `menus/linux.cson` and `menus/win32.cson` to have shortcuts (at lease I think that's what the ampersand is for on the menu labels. I'm on a Mac :apple:)\n- [ ] Edit 2.2 and 2.3 in atom/flight-manual.atom.io to reflect new functions\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12157","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12157/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12157/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/12157/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/12157","id":165194445,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNjUxOTQ0NDU=","number":12157,"title":"Invisibles enhancements and fixes","user":{"login":"lee-dohm","id":1038121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzgxMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1038121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm","html_url":"https://github.com/lee-dohm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-dohm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODU2NDQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":36,"created_at":"2016-07-12T22:16:53Z","updated_at":"2018-02-12T18:02:01Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"In order to clean things up, I'm unifying a number of invisibles-related enhancements and fixes under this one Issue and closing the others.\n- [ ] When `showInvisibles` is off, non-visible characters should be non-visible\n- [ ] When `showInvisibles` is on, all normally non-visible characters (control characters, zero-width spaces, other Unicode weirdness, etc) should be rendered in some way #1839\n- [ ] There should be some way of customizing which non-visible characters are displayed when `showInvisibles` is on (Perhaps by class?

actual folding mechanism is simply wrong and unreliable.\nI often work with big files and use folding to speed up my work.\n\nBut, if the file has a wrong indentation (something not rare if the files

and work on the other parts of the file in a wrong manner.\n\nThe actual code folding is based firstly on indentation then on grammar.\n\nI think that the code folding should be based ONLY on grammar.\nBecause, actually, even when you have a correct grammar (with correct folding rules) you can't be sure that the editor fold the code in the right manner.\n\nHere is some examples to show ,

Now, to actually look at the code of that function I unfold the line where the function begins by clicking the little `>` arrow to it's left.\n\nThe problem is when functions contain other functions, then all the sub-functions are by default folded too. So to see the full code of the sub-function, I need to manually click and unfold each of them, and possibly the sub-sub-functions too. In a language like OCaml, where it's common coding practice to have many nested `let ... in` structures, this makes it a huge pain to use the folding feature.\n\n**Suggested enhancement**\n\nInstead of toggling between fold and unfold when clicking the arrow, instead cycle through \"fold\", \"unfold\", and \"unfold entire tree\".\n\n**Current and suggested behavior**\n\nCurrently, after a fold-all, my code looks like this:\n\n```\n> def foo(n): ...\n```\n\nIf I click the arrow once, I get:\n\n```\n def foo(n):\n>    def bar():...\n>    def boo():...\n```\n\nAnd to see everything I need to click and unfold `bar` and `boo` manually. Clicking the arrow next to `foo` once more just returns it to the folded state in the first code block above.\n\nInstead, I suggest that clicking the `foo` the second time produces this instead:\n\n```\n def foo(n):\n     def bar():\n         pass\n     def boo():\n         pass\n```\n\n**Why would the enhancement be useful to most users**\n\nIt would save users of languages like Ocaml many clicks, and they'd be able to easily see the entire code of a function.\n\nThis feature exists in Emacs, for example, the default behaviour of <Tab> folding in org-mode does exactly this.\n\n**Atom Version:** 1.7.3\n**OS and Version:** OS X 10.10.5\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11760","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11760/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11760/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11760/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11760","id":154951643,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzAxNDQzNzE=","number":11760,"title":"Fixed calling lineTextForBufferRow with unindented lines.","user":{"login":"blacksunrise56","id":12486795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDg2Nzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12486795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blacksunrise56","html_url":"https://github.com/blacksunrise56","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blacksunrise56/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blacksunrise56/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blacksunrise56/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blacksunrise56/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blacksunrise56/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blacksunrise56/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blacksunrise56/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blacksunrise56/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blacksunrise56/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3MjI5NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-05-16T02:55:51Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T16:47:16Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11760","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11760","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11760.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11760.patch"},"body":"Fixes calling `lineTextForBufferRow()` with unindented rows.

seems to be a lot of confusion about the function of the \"Open Empty Editor On Start\" option in the settings. From what I was able to tell the intent of the option was to open a new blank file for editing if when Atom starts if there are no files open. In my build of the current master branch this option has no effect. I have modified the function according to these assumptions. Because many people expected this option to open Atom with all previously open files closed. With this demand in mind I made a new menu option for this feature. It works by closing all files that were to be reopened upon launching Atom. When Atom is closed is stores even the unsaved buffers, so on launch with this option checked it will still ask the user if they would like to save the file. \nHere is a link to a screen capture to demonstrate the way the bug fix and new feature work: https://youtu.be/JCFOm3LdLoU\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11683","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11683/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11683/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11683/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11683","id":152867520,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njg3Njk5NTY=","number":11683,"title":"Fix Double Indent for line continuation #11659","user":{"login":"yufanyufan","id":2504014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDQwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/2504014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufanyufan","html_url":"https://github.com/yufanyufan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufanyufan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufanyufan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufanyufan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufanyufan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufanyufan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufanyufan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufanyufan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufanyufan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yufanyufan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2016-05-03T20:32:11Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T16:47:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11683","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11683","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11683.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11683.patch"},"body":""},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11677","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11677/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11677/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11677/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11677","id":152686522,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njg2NTAxMTM=","number":11677,"title":"Indent Works Properly When AutoIndent Is Unchecked","user":{"login":"ebroom2014","id":19159219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTU5MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/19159219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebroom2014","html_url":"https://github.com/ebroom2014","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebroom2014/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebroom2014/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebroom2014/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebroom2014/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebroom2014/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebroom2014/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebroom2014/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebroom2014/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebroom2014/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":193722948,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3MjI5NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/needs-review","name":"needs-review","color":"bfe5bf","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2016-05-03T02:21:37Z","updated_at":"2018-05-26T16:47:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/pulls/11677","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11677","diff_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11677.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/11677.patch"},"body":"This is in regard to https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10407\n\nBefore when the `AutoIndent` was unchecked and you were to copy and paste a section of text with a newline character, it would still indent.

file manager in Atom, it will first open a new window on the current workspace (A). Opening a second file opens in the same window in a new tab. This is expected.\n\nAfter changing to a different workspace (B) in Ubuntu where no Atom window is present and then opening another file, the file will open in the Atom window present on the first workspace (A). However, the expected behavior is that the file is opened in a new window of Atom.\n\nMy notion of expected behavior is derived from what is done by Gedit, the default text editor on Ubuntu. It also seems more intuitive to me that the file is opened on the workspace I'm currently viewing, even if Atom is already present on a different workspace. This follows an idea of using different workspaces for different tasks.\n\nSome might disagree with this suggestion, but I would still like to see this as an optional behavior because this issue is one of the most often mentioned by those I know who use Atom.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Open a file in Atom from the file manager in Ubuntu on workspace (A).\n2. Change workspace to workspace (B).\n3. Open a second file in Atom from the file manager.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Two Atom windows open, one on workspace (A) with the first file and one on workspace (B) with the second file.\n\n**Actual behavior:** One Atom window opened on workspace (A) with both files.\n### Versions\n\nUbuntu 15.10 and Ubuntu 16.04 running Unity 7.\n\n``` bash\n$ atom --version\nAtom    : 1.7.2\nElectron: 0.36.8\nChrome  : 47.0.2526.110\nNode    : 5.1.1\n\n$ apm --version\napm  1.9.2\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11+\ngit 2.7.4\n```\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11456","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11456/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11456/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11456/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11456","id":148241075,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNDgyNDEwNzU=","number":11456,"title":"Error moving files across mounts or drives, \"Failed to move entry EXDEV: cross-device link not permitted\"","user":{"login":"johnsonz","id":2533629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzM2Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2533629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonz","html_url":"https://github.com/johnsonz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonz/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2016-04-14T03:27:36Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T00:56:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"*Edit by @rsese to add issue template details*\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* [x] Put an X between the brackets on this line if you have done all of the following:\r\n    * Reproduced the problem in Safe Mode: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode\r\n    * Followed all applicable steps in the debugging guide: https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/\r\n    * Checked the FAQs on the message board for common solutions: https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq\r\n    * Checked that your issue isn't already filed: https://github.com/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom\r\n    * Checked that there is not already an Atom package that provides the described functionality: https://atom.io/packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nYou can't drag and drop a file across mounts or drives and will get an error.

behavior:** According to the API docs, line 52 should be scrolled to the center of the editor.\n\n**Actual behavior:** Nothing happens.\n### Further information\n\nBefore

it's the first time working with a RTL language, but I'm experiencing some rendering issues with a specific text. I have the following SQL insert statement:\n\n``` sql\nINSERT INTO `dwp_terms` VALUES\n  (19,'عين المدينة','3ayn-almadina',0);\n```\n\nWhich renders incorrectly. It seems it might be a Webkit bug, but I'm not sure. It might also be that the text is ill formatted, but it seems to render correctly in Firefox and Apple Notes, albeit with the words in reverse. I've included a screenshot from Sublime Text 3 which seems to render as I expected.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Use the following piece of text as a template `(19,'','3ayn-almadina',0),`\n2. Paste `عين المدينة` into the empty quotes\n3. Incorrect rendering\n\nI do not know if this applies to more RTL scripts, but I've been working with about 40 terms that were \"converted\" to `INSERT` statements, and this was the only one causing trouble.\n\n**Expected behavior:** here rendered with Sublime Text 3 (however, seems to not render arabic correctly)\n\n<img width=\"406\" alt=\"Sublime Text 3 Rendering\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/416524/14080299/6a4500c4-f504-11e5-95a2-db7c83200a0a.png\">\n\n**Actual behavior:** rendered with Atom 1.6.0\n\n<img width=\"332\" alt=\"Atom Rendering\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/416524/14080298/6a2dc788-f504-11e5-8067-d7f7badda11b.png\">\n\nThe generated HTML, which looks correct:\n\n``` html\n<span class=\"source pgsql\">\n  <span class=\"meta statement pgsql\">\n    <span class=\"leading-whitespace indent-guide\">  </span>\n    (\n    <span class=\"constant numeric pgsql\">19</span>\n    ,\n    <span class=\"string quoted single pgsql\">\n      <span class=\"punctuation definition string begin pgsql\">'</span>\n      عين المدينة'\n    </span>\n    ,\n    <span class=\"string quoted single pgsql\">\n      <span class=\"punctuation definition string begin pgsql\">'</span>\n      3ayn-almadina'\n    </span>\n    ,\n    <span class=\"constant numeric pgsql\">0</span>\n    ),\n  </span>\n</span>\n```\n### Versions\n\n``` sh\n$ atom --version\n1.6.0\n$ apm --version\napm  1.6.0\nnpm  2.13.3\nnode 0.10.40\npython 2.7.11\ngit 2.7.2\n```\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11249","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11249/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11249/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11249/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11249","id":142852981,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNDI4NTI5ODE=","number":11249,"title":"Hide atom-overlay when not visible","user":{"login":"simurai","id":378023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODAyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/378023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai","html_url":"https://github.com/simurai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simurai/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODU2NDQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":97310502,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzMxMDUwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/help-wanted","name":"help-wanted","color":"159818","default":false},{"id":193722981,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTM3MjI5ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/ui","name":"ui","color":"99cc00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2016-03-23T03:57:51Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T11:03:09Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"### Prerequisites\n- [x] Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode)?\n- [x] Are you running the [latest version of Atom](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging#update-to-the-latest-version)?\n- [x] Did you check the [debugging guide](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-debugging)?\n- [x] Did you check the [FAQs on Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)?\n- [x] Are you reporting to the [correct repository](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#atom-and-packages)?\n- [x] Did you [perform a cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+-repo%3Aatom%2Felectron) to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?\n\nFor more information on how to write a good [bug report](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report) or [enhancement request](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion), see the `CONTRIBUTING` guide.\n### Description\n\nThis issue came up [here](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui/pull/127).\n\nCurrently `atom-overlay`s overlap the rest of the UI. I think it's ok, but only as long as the current line is visible. If you scroll it \"out of sight\", it looks odd having the overlay still be shown.\n\nA possible solution might be to try to detect when the current line is not visible and then hide the `atom-overlay`. I think autocomplete kinda already tries to do that by jumping to the top when scrolling down, but doesn't hide completely. And would be nice if it's part of the core behavior, so all packages would get it. Maybe with an option to opt-out if a package wants stay visible all the time.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

It also makes wrapping a folded block with more code easier because you can see the beginning and end of the full statement.\n\nThe other problem with the current Atom folding method is indenting a folded function does not work properly.\n\n**JavaScript Example**:\n![Indenting folded JavaScript in Atom](https://zippy.gfycat.com/ExcellentMerryCoyote.gif)\n\n**HTML Example**:\n![Indenting folded HTML in Atom](https://zippy.gfycat.com/FarTenseAdeliepenguin.gif)\n\n@lee-dohm suggested I provide some examples of other folds besides just the [1TBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS) style. I've noted some proposals:\n\n**Stroustrup**:\n\n``` c++\n// Example\nclass Vector { \n  public:\n      Vector(int s) :elem(new double[s]), sz(s) { }\n      double& operator[](int i) { return elem[i]; }\n      int size() { return sz; } \n  private:\n      double elem[lowast];\n      int sz;\n};\n\n// Expected\nclass Vector {\n  public:...\n  private:...\n}\n```\n\n**Allman**:\n\n``` js\n// Example\nwhile (x == y)\n{\n  something();\n  somethingelse();\n}\n\n// Expected\nwhile (x == y)\n{\n}\n```\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Launch Atom\n2. In the correct syntax (not just \"Plain Text\"), write a multiline, indented function/block\n3. Collapse block\n4. (To replicate indentation issue) Indent the folded, one-line block\n### Versions\n\n**Atom**: 1.5.4\n**apm**: 1.6.0\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11114","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11114/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11114/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/11114/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/11114","id":139645941,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMzk2NDU5NDE=","number":11114,"title":"Identical folders are opened as separate projects on case-insensitive filesystems","user":{"login":"alexchandel","id":637714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/637714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel","html_url":"https://github.com/alexchandel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexchandel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-03-09T17:24:06Z","updated_at":"2016-12-29T13:21:17Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"### Description\n\nOn case-insensitive (but case-preserving) filesystems, opening a project by passing its folder to the `atom` command will not restore the project, if the path given has the wrong case.\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1.

I exit Atom and window state is restored, its size is remembered; so when I start Atom again, the window starts restored and remembers its size. However, when I exit Atom maximized, the restored window size is set to maximized size; so when I start Atom again, it start maximized and when I click restore, the window size remains just the same (maximized size).\n\nSimply said, nonmaximized window is too often set to maximized size and is just too big to normaly drag around and I have to manually resize window to smaller size each time.\n\n**Reproduction Steps:**\n1. Exit Atom maximized\n2. Start Atom again and click \"restore window\"\n3. The window size is same as maximized\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nRestored window size should be remembered correctly, so you can actually restore window to its last size, not restore it to maximized size.\n\n**Observed behavior:**\n\nI am unable to test this on different OS than Windows 10. I think it's not Electron bug, since VS Code behaves correctly. The reason why this bothers me is that I can't just grab maximized window and drag it, because it's size is same as maximized (= just too big for dragging around screen).\n\n**Screenshots and GIFs**\n\n![output_qijguj](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6060970/12868449/857bc078-cd07-11e5-9b7b-768d7669e253.gif)\n\n**Atom version:** 1.4.3\n**OS and version:** Windows 10\n\n**Installed packages:**\n\nminimap\n\n**Additional information:**\n- Problem can be reproduced in safe mode: Yes\n- Problem started happening recently, didn't happen in an older version of Atom: No\n- Problem can be reliably reproduced, doesn't happen randomly: Yes\n- Problem happens with all files and projects, not only some files or projects: Yes\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10714","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10714/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10714/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10714/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10714","id":131807238,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMzE4MDcyMzg=","number":10714,"title":"Graphical glitches that occur under Arch Linux","user":{"login":"fusion809","id":4717341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTczNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/4717341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusion809","html_url":"https://github.com/fusion809","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusion809/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusion809/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusion809/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusion809/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusion809/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusion809/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusion809/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusion809/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fusion809/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":84710475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NDcxMDQ3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/editor-rendering","name":"editor-rendering","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":97577987,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzU3Nzk4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":20,"created_at":"2016-02-06T01:54:46Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T15:04:59Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi,\n\nI have noticed that Atom 1.4.3 (have not noticed this issue with earlier releases of Atom) keeps experiencing graphical glitches, wherein tab titles, the toolbar and file windows become invisible or otherwise visually obstructed.

These bugs seem to be plugin-independent as running Atom in safe mode makes no difference to these bugs. \n\nIn this first example, you can see the second tab is partially obstructed in its view from the glitch.\n\n![](http://imgur.com/a9IO6Sn.png)\n\nIn this second example, you can see parts of the file window and the left and centre tabs obstructed in their view:\n\n![](http://imgur.com/a31M6oZ.png)\n\nI know that some things seem to trigger its appearance, like scrolling down on larger files, switching between presently-opened windows, _etc._ If you want to know how I installed Atom well I installed it from my own PKGBUILD (which builds the Atom package from source code not from a Debian or RPM binary) which you can find [here](https://github.com/fusion809/PKGBUILDs/blob/master/atom-editor/PKGBUILD).

Some features are more obvious like Dev Mode and Safe Mode, but even then the full effects of each of these modes are not fully documented anywhere and therefore they are often misunderstood even by people who use these modes often. The purpose of this Issue initially is to capture the list of initial states that people want to launch Atom into. Eventually we will create a plan and design for making each of them easy, well understood and as obvious as possible to newcomers to Atom. If possible, I'll add links to other Issues, PRs, Discuss topics and other sources to illustrate.\n## Atom Launch Modes\n\nThese are the modes that Atom more-or-less supports or are implied by the modes that Atom does support.\n- Project (whether with single or multiple roots)\n- No project &mdash; Open specific files with no tree view\n- Restore last state (project or no project)\n- Restore specific project state\n- Dev Mode &mdash; Since this is designed as an aid for Atom development, it mostly only makes sense in combination with the project mode (but perhaps I'm overlooking something)\n- Safe Mode &mdash; Can be combined with any of the above modes (other than Dev Mode)\n\nEach of these should have an obvious and unambiguous way of launching them both from the command line and from the GUI.\n### Additional Command Line Thoughts\n\nSometimes people want to modify the state of Atom from the command line and sometimes they don't. Some consideration should be given to these scenarios:\n- Add a file to an open session of Atom\n- Add a project root to an open session of Atom\n- Launch Atom in any mode when an open session of Atom is running (even when it may seem the user may want one of the two above but doesn't ... for instance \"open a file that exists in the project that is open in the current session of Atom, but I want it in a new Atom session with **no** project\")\n## Mode State\n\nThere are things that are serialized and stored when Atom exits. It is completely non-obvious what items belong to this set and what items do not as well as how to restore the saved items when next launching Atom. Decisions should be made about whether some of these items belong to the specific mode that Atom is in or if they are more global state that people expect to be in place the next time Atom is launched (or even an individual file is opened post-launch) no matter what mode Atom is launched in.\n- List of open tabs\n- Editor state &mdash; Where the cursor is in the file, etc\n- Unsaved changes to files\n- Untitled buffers\n- Per file indentation settings\n- Per file line ending settings\n- Per file encoding settings\n- [Pane configuration](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/10545)\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10455","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10455/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10455/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/10455/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/10455","id":127030717,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTYyNTU1MjU=","number":10455,"title":"add

This may not be a bug in the sense that the behavior may be intended, but many text editors (apple text input boxes, emacs) have better behavior.\n\nTo reproduce, enter the following text:\n\n```\nmultiple words;)\n```\n\nDouble-click and hold on the word `multiple` - this will select the word `multiple` and as expected enter a \"per-word\" selection drag.  Move the mouse to the right and the word `words` will be correctly selected all at once.  However, it is impossible to add the `;` to the selection without the `)`.  This is different behavior than you would see in some other text editors, including emacs and Mac OS default input fields.\n\nThe reason this is bad is it is harder than other editors to select `multiple words;`, without the close parenthesis.

steps from @damieng https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9550#issuecomment-322591908 \r\n\r\n1. Install atom-ide-ui package\r\n2. Open the diagnostics pane\r\n3. Switch from One Light to One Dark or vice-versa\r\n4. Observe wrong color for table column header\r\n\r\nActual part of the css is\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.nuclide-ui-table-header {\r\n  font-weight: bold;\r\n  background-color: @pane-item-background-color;\r\n  border-bottom: 1px solid @base-border-color;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `@pane-item-background-color` is still resolving to the old value.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### UI theme\r\n\r\nThis can especially be seen when switching from white to black themes or reverse:\r\n![themeswitching](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11966684/11130908/f63e6bf8-8987-11e5-9162-00a59b8124d8.PNG)\r\n![themeswitching2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11966684/11131319/70b2a4ec-898a-11e5-94ce-19dd86b7d37b.PNG)\r\n\r\nWhen restarting Atom the theme is correctly applied. However at least one package also often ignores a restart and show the wrong colour. This is:\r\n- editor-stats as reported [here](https://github.com/atom/editor-stats/issues/28) already previously where this issue only was about this single addon\r\n\r\nAnd FYI when switching back to the theme you switched from everything is displayed normally (or as before you switched - `editor-stats` still looks like it looked always)\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the issue https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8860 which was fixed before, but Atom does not show any warnings in the developer console.\r\n### Syntax theme\r\n\r\nI can also see this happening with the sytax theme. However here it only applies to `markdown-preview` (same issues as above; works when restarting Atom) and the editor seems to be changed correctly.\r\nHowever when looking more carefully even here sometimes it does also not correctly change the font colour of a file (reproduced with a markdown file). When switching to a dark syntax theme the text stays grew. In this case also the global font setting is not applied correctly and does not change the font (note that it was correctly applied to a file opened after changing the theme).\r\n\r\nOne time it also did not changed the colour of the line numbers:\r\n![linenumbers](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11966684/11131689/2eeb2c6c-898c-11e5-9bf6-56956492bb67.PNG)\r\n\r\nAtom 1.1.0\r\nWindows

That's kind of a confusing sentence so I'll elaborate.  In this repo https://github.com/acb/Atom-Test there is a branch `master` with the file `master.txt` in it.  There is also a branch `dev` that has a file `dev.txt` in it that does not exist in `master`.\n\nNow perform the following steps (leaving `dev.txt` open in Atom the entire time):\n1. `git checkout dev`\n2. Alter `dev.txt` in some way\n3. `git stash` -- changes in `dev.txt` are stashed and the buffer in Atom changes appropriately\n4. `git checkout master`\n5. `git checkout dev`\n6. `git stash pop` -- changes in `dev.txt` are `pop`ped to disk, but the buffer in Atom **does not** update\n\nNo errors are shown in the console.\n\nIf this goes undected by the user they could accidentally save `dev.txt` and blow away their stashed changes without any warning.  The solution as of now is to close the file (and DON'T SAVE CHANGES when prompted) and reopen.  In Sublime Text in this situation you get a prompt stating that the file changed on disk and asking you if you would like to reload.\n\nAttached is a gif of the behavior.  Please let me know if I can provide any more information, and feel free to use the repo linked above for any testing you may need.\n\n![atom-bug](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4690898/10678022/bcda2682-78dd-11e5-830e-c29b223c1763.gif)\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9247","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9247/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9247/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/9247/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/9247","id":112675988,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMTI2NzU5ODg=","number":9247,"title":"Multiple Atom release channels can't be installed side-by-side on Windows","user":{"login":"MethodGrab","id":2421069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjEwNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2421069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MethodGrab","html_url":"https://github.com/MethodGrab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MethodGrab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MethodGrab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MethodGrab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MethodGrab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MethodGrab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MethodGrab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MethodGrab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MethodGrab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MethodGrab/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":990818455,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTA4MTg0NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/:night_with_stars:%20nightly-releases","name":":night_with_stars: nightly-releases","color":"bfb6ef","default":false},{"id":176631763,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY2MzE3NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/installer","name":"installer","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false},{"id":62363277,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjM2MzI3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"damieng","id":118951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODk1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/118951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng","html_url":"https://github.com/damieng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"damieng","id":118951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODk1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/118951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng","html_url":"https://github.com/damieng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/damieng/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":17,"created_at":"2015-10-21T20:49:29Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T19:27:19Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"**Expected**\nAccording to the [beta info page](https://atom.io/beta) Atom Beta should \"run side-by-side with Atom stable\".

We release once a week, and every week over a half million people need to go through this process.\n\nThere are [errors](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7854), [bugs](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6482), folks want [better feedback](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8038), and the squirrel icon + release notes are really really confusing:\n- https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/511\n- https://github.com/atom/release-notes/pull/38\n- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5692\n- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6922\n- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/3757\n- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8265\n### What happens now\n- Download an [old version](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.0.18)\n- Start it\n- Notice there is a blue squirrel in the status bar, and it says 'view release notes'\n- Click the squirrel\n- See the release notes, note that they are showing notes for an old release\n- Click the restart and update button\n- Atom quits, notice that there is no feedback as to what is happening.\n- It's still not back. What's up?\n- Atom restarts again after 5 - 15 seconds\n- Notice that the release notes are up in the reloaded window. They are still out of date, and still have the 'Restart and Update' button showing and enabled\n- Notice that the squirrel icon is still showing, and still blue, with the same tooltip text\n- I click the squirrel because it's still there, and not going away. It focuses the release notes. Ok.\n- I'm thinking: is there another update??!? What is happening?\n- I check the atom menu\n  - Click the 'About' item, theres no information saying it's the latest version\n  - I notice there is a version number, and a 'Check for update'\n  - Nothing indicates I'm at the latest version\n- On reload, squirrel goes away; still nothing tells me I'm at the latest version. But no squirrel, so I guess so?\n### A 70% fix\n\ntl;dr: fix the squirrel icon, remove the release notes package, use the about package for update status (similar to chrome).\n- An update becomes available\n- The blue squirrel shows, its tooltip says \"Downloading update for version 1.0.20...\"\n- Clicking the squirrel shows the about page which shows\n  - the current version\n  - new version detected\n  - some text indicating that the update is being downloaded\n- When it's finished downloading:\n  - the blue squirrel turns green, with a tooltip of \"Version 1.0.20 is available\"\n  - the about page now shows that an update is available, and has a button to restart the editor\n  - The menu item now takes you to the about page\n- Clicking the green squirrel still shows / focuses the about page\n- Clicking reload reloads the editor like today\n- On reload the about page is shown.\n- The about page indicates that you are up to date, and has a link to the release notes\n- The squirrel is _gone_ after reload as the about page has the relevant information\n\nAdditionally, take a stab at the bugs:\n- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/7854\n- https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6482\n\nBonus:\n- In the about page, indicate which release rail you are on. beta? stable? development?\n### An extra 10%\n\nAdd some kind of feedback when atom is reloading.

This is related to #4974, #4975, and #4122.\n## The Issue:\n\nTrying to use Atom at work (to hopefully replace Notepad++), and was able to install Atom fine without a problem. However, when I went to install some packages, I received the following error:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7026750/9408312/9fad910e-47df-11e5-8bb3-ff1230a1939f.png)\n\nSame thing for themes:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7026750/9408324/bcc3a9ae-47df-11e5-8f5b-16b14509cc4c.png)\n\nAnd same thing for the featured packages:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7026750/9408333/d64225cc-47df-11e5-93d7-2526ee7d3339.png)\n\nAnd featured themes:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7026750/9408336/e8349b98-47df-11e5-84d9-e235e9b05ccb.png)\n## Background:\n\nWe use [Palo Alto Security Appliances](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/platforms/firewalls/pa-5000/overview.html) to protect our ingress and egress network traffic from malware and other threats to our network and data. Palo Alto does this by using a wildcard certificate that has been generated from our Enterprise PKI and which is trusted on all Company-owned workstations and servers.\n\n> Not looking to get into a debate about SSL decryption or man-in-the-middle attacks for SSL. This is at my work, and we have legal and regulatory requirements to break SSL, inspect the traffic, and then re-encrypt it before it leaves our network.\n\nI know _why_ Atom is failing here. It's seeing what it thinks is a bad certificate in the mix, and that the traffic is being attacked (MiTM). I understand _why_ Atom is failing here. But in this case, the traffic is _legitimately_ being broken, for _legitimate_ reasons.\n## Feature Request:\n\nI would like to request the addition of a hidden configuration option that, when enabled, would cause Atom to **ignore SSL certificate errors**.\n\n> Yes I know this is risky for end-users. Yes, I know this reduces the overall security, which is why I don't think the configuration setting should be easily \"discoverable\" or that there shouldn't be a UI element for it. Hopefully that wouldn't allow a non-technical user to accidentally enable it and potentially reduce their security.\n### Alternately:\n\nIf Atom would show the actual URL that's being blocked, or that raised the error, we could then add the URL to a white-list to bypass SSL decryption on our side, allowing packages and themes  to be installed.\n\nOf course, it would be helpful if packages and themes were distributed from a central repository with a common organizational structure and naming convention. :smile: \n\n---\n\nThanks so much for considering this feature request.\n\nRunning Atom 1.0.7 on Windows 7 Enterprise SP1.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8430","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8430/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8430/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/8430/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/8430","id":101714642,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMDE3MTQ2NDI=","number":8430,"title":"There is no naming convention of scope selectors","user":{"login":"MaximSokolov","id":2943616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDM2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2943616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximSokolov","html_url":"https://github.com/MaximSokolov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximSokolov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximSokolov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximSokolov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximSokolov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximSokolov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximSokolov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximSokolov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximSokolov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaximSokolov/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":104428530,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDQ0Mjg1MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/documentation","name":"documentation","color":"c7def8","default":false},{"id":7856440,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODU2NDQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2015-08-18T18:02:58Z","updated_at":"2018-01-19T04:29:11Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"I assume Atom follows TextMate [naming conventions](http://manual.macromates.com/en/language_grammars#naming_conventions), but there is no mention about it.

Showing them all the time is too noisy, not showing them at all loses their power, and turning them off and on when I want to see them is annoying. I'm aware that with CSS we cannot achieve what is required (hence unresolved #3249, and accompanying [forum post](https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-is-so-powerful-that-it-blows-my-mind/294/17?)) due to the underlayer controlling the background highlight. So this will presumably be something that atom must provide from within the core.\n\nIf this request appeals more as something that's more generic (and allow us to achieve what we want with CSS) you could actually just attach a `.selected` class to all elements (scopes) that are within the selection (obviously a selection part-way through an element will require an inner span injected with just the `.selected` class). This way, we can do what we want in regards to the invisibles, but package developers may find interesting ways to use this selection class/scope for other purposes.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6666","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6666/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6666/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/6666/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6666","id":73540381,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzU0MDM4MQ==","number":6666,"title":"no mnemonics in menus (File, Edit, ...)","user":{"login":"kolAflash","id":3355089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTUwODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3355089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolAflash","html_url":"https://github.com/kolAflash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolAflash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolAflash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolAflash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolAflash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolAflash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolAflash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolAflash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolAflash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kolAflash/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":258255692,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTgyNTU2OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/electron","name":"electron","color":"A5ECFA","default":false},{"id":97577987,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzU3Nzk4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/linux","name":"linux","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":10,"created_at":"2015-05-06T07:22:53Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T16:45:31Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"My system:\nLinux\nDesktop: KDE 4.14.6\n\nIn the menus there are any mnemonics shown at all!\n(the menu buttons themselves show mnemonics when pressing ALT)\nE.g. in File menu:\n\n```\nNew Window\nNew File\nOpen File\n...\n```\n\ndon't show any mnemonics.

I'll summarize the essence that relates to Atom, right here. Consider this snippet of Python:\n\n``` python\ndef maps():\n    print \"maps maps maps\"\n\ndef spam():\n    print \"Erasing everything...\"\n    print \"done.\"\n\ns = \"spam‮\" ,spam ,\"‬spam\"\n# ^ attention to this line: try selecting it with your mouse\ns[1]()\n```\n\nThat line, properly escaped:\n\n``` python\ns = \"spam&#8238;\" ,spam ,\"&#8236;spam\"\n```\n\nThe symbols of interest, in order of appearance, are `&#8238;` or RLO (right-to-left override) and `&#8236;` or PDF (pop directional formatting). They, respectively, reverse text direction and set it back.\n\nAtom expands this combination just like a browser would, it actually displays that RLO-PDF piece in reverse. However, interaction with it is... awkward. Start with the fact that you can't (at least visually) move your cursor inside that gap in any way.\n\nLook at this. With \"Plain text\" grammar on, I've selected that line:\n\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/q6KKB0M.png)\n\nNoticed that? 10 units of extra space. Notice also, that between RLO and PDF are exactly 10 characters. That's a hint. However, once I switch on Python grammar (and RLO-PDF interval is now contained in multiple elements), things get even more awkward.\n\n![Screenshot 2](http://i.imgur.com/QpOpCDm.png)\n\nNot 10 units, as before. Now we have only 4. And from that moment, I don't have a slightest clue about what's going on, but something needs to be done about that.\n\nThis needs a discussion. I can immediately come up with these two general directions:\n1. Interpret as designed in Unicode. Fix the UI, make the cursor work properly and not introduce gaps like the ones above.\n2. Represent Unicode control characters with some sort of \"placeholders\" and don't let them act as designed in Unicode.\n\nPersonally, I stand for placeholders, as Atom is mostly a code editor, and code is a raw sequence of characters. It makes sense for Atom to display it as closely as possible to how the parser will see it.\n\nIn those cases when plain text is used to author a document that makes use of these sequences to display properly, \"preview\" plugins come into play and let you preview the document as it will look after processing.\n\nThoughts?\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5967","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5967/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5967/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/5967/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/5967","id":61521477,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MTUyMTQ3Nw==","number":5967,"title":"Three finger tap for definitions doesn't work on OS X ","user":{"login":"barksten","id":1151567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTE1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1151567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/barksten","html_url":"https://github.com/barksten","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barksten/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barksten/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barksten/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barksten/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barksten/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barksten/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barksten/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barksten/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/barksten/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":98445015,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5ODQ0NTAxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":12,"created_at":"2015-03-14T09:19:11Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T18:50:25Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"In a Mac text view or web view, when you three finger tap a word it becomes yellow and a popover window with definitions (from country specific dictionaries and wikipedia) appears.

of vaguely explaining, here are the steps for reproducing the bug:\n1. If you have a Yeoman-created project folder i.e. `generator-webapp` created project, run `grunt serve`. It'll create a .tmp file, and I'll assume you haven't had one at first.\n2. When everything goes well expand the folder .tmp in Atom so you can see the subfolders inside.\n3. Stop the grunt process.\n4. Run `grunt serve` again, and it will run `grunt-contrib-clean` to delete .tmp. \n\nIt won't. .tmp will still exist as a \"corrupted file\" and you can't delete it by the Windows Explorer. Command line will show `Warning: Unable to create directory [path to .tmp folder]\" (Error code: EPERM). Use --force to continue.` when trying to create a new .tmp folder.\n\nGo to Atom and try to delete it, and the Dev Tools will show the same error: `Uncaught Error: EPERM, operation not permitted: [path to .tmp folder]`.

Doing it without triggering a reflow for each tab stop (to query the current width of the line being composed) is even harder. It would require pre-caching the em-width of every character for the current font, or something along those lines.\n\nBut it's one of those features that would set Atom apart from any other editor.\n\nAgain, the tricky part is just the configurable tab stops. That would allow extension writers to align code, tables, and other data with various algorithms, including Elastic tabstops.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2456","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2456/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2456/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/2456/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2456","id":34667480,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDY2NzQ4MA==","number":2456,"title":"Atom over sshfs Unusably Slow","user":{"login":"martindale","id":129761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/129761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martindale","html_url":"https://github.com/martindale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martindale/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martindale/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martindale/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martindale/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martindale/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martindale/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martindale/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martindale/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martindale/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":33602150,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzYwMjE1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7","default":true},{"id":247105569,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDcxMDU1Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/git","name":"git","color":"fef2c0","default":false},{"id":192100748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTIxMDA3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/network","name":"network","color":"f7c6c7","default":false},{"id":52925411,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MjkyNTQxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"d4c5f9","default":false},{"id":505038679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1MDUwMzg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/triaged","name":"triaged","color":"00bb00","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":108,"created_at":"2014-05-30T18:02:05Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T17:26:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","body":"When editing files over an sshfs connection, it takes long periods of time to perform basic actions (directory expansion, file opening).

I'm hoping that one of you core guys sees a super easy way to do it :)\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/380","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/380/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/380/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/380/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/380","id":11772555,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMTc3MjU1NQ==","number":380,"title":"How do I unsplit panes?","user":{"login":"jbarnette","id":3117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarnette","html_url":"https://github.com/jbarnette","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarnette/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarnette/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarnette/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarnette/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarnette/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarnette/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarnette/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarnette/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbarnette/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODU2NDQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":33,"created_at":"2013-03-07T18:28:02Z","updated_at":"2018-01-27T14:43:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Splitting panes is easy: I got `C-|` and `C--` into my fingers quickly. What's hard for me is unsplits. Currently it looks like I have to `M-w` until I've closed every tab in the pane, at which point it goes away.\n\nThe problem for me is that I don't use tabs, and I don't think of files being open in a pane. I think of them as being open in _Atom_ and displayed in a pane when I ask for 'em.\n\nWhen I think about unsplitting I don't connect it to the idea of closing files at all. I'd love it if unsplitting was a pane-level concern like splitting is.\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/345","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/345/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/345/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/issues/345/events","html_url":"https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/345","id":11637482,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMTYzNzQ4Mg==","number":345,"title":"Elastic scrolling not working on editors","user":{"login":"dgraham","id":122102,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjEwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/122102?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgraham","html_url":"https://github.com/dgraham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgraham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgraham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgraham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgraham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgraham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgraham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgraham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgraham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgraham/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":true},"labels":[{"id":7856440,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODU2NDQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"bfd4f2","default":true},{"id":98445015,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5ODQ0NTAxNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atom/atom/labels/mac","name":"mac","color":"c7def8","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":14,"created_at":"2013-03-04T20:30:20Z","updated_at":"2017-12-23T13:01:43Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Can the rubber band scroll effect at the top and bottom of the editor when reaching the end of the scrollable area be enabled?
